Section 5.5 — Cross-References & Reading Order
Source: Part V.V — MARKO RODIN & VORTEX MATHE.txt

Suggested Reading Order (to build foundations → tests)
1) V.0 (Notation, units, toroidal coordinates)
2) V.3 (Geometry/topology of windings)
3) V.4 (EM modeling: J, A, Biot–Savart, B decomposition)
4) V.5 (Inductance & coupling)
5) V.6.1 and V.6.3 (Modal analysis and resonant conditions)
6) V.7.1 and V.7.4 (Resonance relations; Poynting flow)
7) V.9–V.12 (Experimental design → verification)
8) V.14–V.15 (Null tests → publication roadmap)
9) V.2.3, V.6.2, V.7.2–V.7.3, V.8 (speculative; handle last with caution)

Cross-Reference Map
- Coordinates: V.0.3 ↔ Appendix V.A (A1), used in V.3 and all geometry.
- Biot–Savart: V.4.3 ↔ Appendix V.A (A2); inputs from V.3.1–V.3.2.
- Inductance: V.5.1–V.5.2 ↔ Path definitions in V.3; compare with V.5.4.
- Modal analysis: V.6.1 (decomposition) feeds V.6.3 (resonance) and tests in V.6.2 (speculative).
- Resonance/Q: V.7.1 relies on L_eff, C_eff from V.5 and modal structure from V.6.
- Poynting: V.7.4 uses E, B from V.4 outputs.
- Experimentation: V.9 variables feed V.12 analyses; V.14 provides artifact controls.
- Speculative constructs: Appendix V.B summarizes V.2.3, V.7.3, V.8.3 for separation.
