Section 4 — Structured Notes (source-grounded)
Sources: PART IV overview and Chapters 17–25 analysis files

Definitions/Terminology
- Multi‑coil resonance, phase coherence, nonlinear phenomena, high‑Q experiments [PART IV Lines 3–28; Ch.17].
- Tesla coil geometry/performance, energy transfer regimes, safety/metrology [PART IV Lines 29–53; Ch.18].
- Vortex geometries: flux tubes, vortex loops, arrays; stability and synchronization [PART IV Lines 55–77; Ch.19].
- Rodin & vortex mathematics (pre‑equations): modular cycles, node mapping, experimental relevance [PART IV Lines 79–103; Ch.20].
- Tesla HF experiments: resonant transmission, longitudinal hypotheses, network behaviors [PART IV Lines 105–127; Ch.21].
- Harmonic/toroidal coupling: flux confinement, phase coherence, harmonic networks, applications [PART IV Lines 129–153; Ch.22].
- Quantum/subtle energy: low‑energy anomalies, spin coherence, detection methods [PART IV Lines 155–177; Ch.23].
- Experimental design & validation: build, measure, reproducibility [PART IV Lines 179–203; Ch.24].
- Transition to equations & synthesis: parametrization, harmonic decomposition, variable inventories [PART IV Lines 205–227; Ch.25].

Core Equations (explicit in sources)
- Coupled‑pair resonance split: f±≈f0√(1±k) [Ch.17 Lines 15–17].

Cautions/Limitations
- Multiple chapters highlight missing numeric targets (f0, Q, k, breakdown margins, coherence times, etc.) requiring later quantification [Ch.17 Lines 12–13; Ch.18 Lines 11–13; Ch.19 Lines 11–13; Ch.21 Lines 11–13; Ch.22 Lines 11–13; Ch.23 Lines 11–13; Ch.24 Lines 11–13; Ch.25 Lines 11–13].

Separation
- Mainstream/procedural: resonance systems, Tesla geometry/safety, harmonic networks, experimental protocols.
- Hypotheses to test: Rodin pre‑equations encoding; Tesla longitudinal claims; subtle energy/coherence assertions; preliminary over‑unity setups.
