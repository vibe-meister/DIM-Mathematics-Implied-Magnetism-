CHAPTER 24: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & MEASUREMENT PROTOCOLS — ANALYSIS
==================================================================

Scope note
Build (24.1), measure (24.2), and validate (24.3). Fabrication tolerances, instrument chains, and reproducibility controls.

Interesting patterns
- Treats fabrication precision, metrology capability, and documentation as coupled pillars.
- Pushes time‑synchronized acquisition and control experiments.

Missing numbers
- Tolerances for geometry, measurement accuracy, validation thresholds; sensor bandwidth/noise specs.

Basic insight
- Scientific credibility depends on reproducibility scaffolding as much as on device ingenuity.
