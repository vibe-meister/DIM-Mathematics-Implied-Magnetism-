Section 4 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) PART IV overview [PART IV Lines 1–2]
2) High-level resonance systems [PART IV Lines 2–28]
3) Tesla coils & high-frequency phenomena [PART IV Lines 29–53]
4) Vortex geometries [PART IV Lines 54–77]
5) Rodin & vortex mathematics (pre‑equations) [PART IV Lines 79–103]
6) Tesla HF experiments & theories [PART IV Lines 105–127]
7) Harmonic & toroidal coupling [PART IV Lines 129–153]
8) Experimental design & measurement protocols [PART IV Lines 179–203]
9) Transition to equations & synthesis [PART IV Lines 205–227]

Dependencies
- Resonance/Tesla geometry → vortex arrays → harmonic/toroidal networks → protocols → synthesis toward Part V.
