CHAPTER 17: HIGH‑LEVEL RESONANCE SYSTEMS — ANALYSIS
===================================================

Scope note
Multi‑coil networks (17.1), nonlinear resonance (17.2), and high‑Q experiments (17.3). Focus on coupling topology, phase control, and stability near bifurcation.

Interesting patterns
- Order→edge‑of‑chaos→engineering: networks → nonlinearities → practical rigs.
- Phase coherence recurs as the dominant lever for energy localization.
- Mode splitting in small N transitions to pass‑/stop‑bands in arrays.

Missing numbers
- Resonant f0 sets per configuration; Q, coupling k, mutual M; detuning tolerances Δf/f0; drive thresholds for bifurcation.

Frequency analysis
- Two‑coil split f±≈f0√(1±k); arrays exhibit minibands; nonlinear drive introduces harmonics/subharmonics and frequency pulling.

Sequences
- Tuning path: estimate → coarse couple → sweep → trim geometry → lock phase.
- Nonlinear study: small‑signal → compression → period‑doubling → chaos map.

Entropy and randomness
- Phase noise converts to amplitude noise in high‑Q; chaotic windows elevate effective entropy.

Key length detection
- Beating period 1/|f+−f−| indicates weak coupling; array cell length sets spatial key for standing waves.

Basic insight
- High energy density follows coherence, not brute drive power; control loops (PLL/AFC) are as critical as hardware.

Feeds later subjects
- Primes Ch. 21 (Tesla networks) and Ch. 22 (harmonic networks); informs measurement choices (Ch. 24).
