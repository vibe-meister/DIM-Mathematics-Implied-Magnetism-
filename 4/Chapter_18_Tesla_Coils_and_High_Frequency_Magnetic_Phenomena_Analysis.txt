CHAPTER 18: TESLA COILS & HIGH‑FREQUENCY PHENOMENA — ANALYSIS
=============================================================

Scope note
Geometry (18.1), transfer (18.2), and safety/metrology (18.3) for high‑frequency/high‑voltage resonators.

Interesting patterns
- Geometry→performance mapping (N, topload C, ground return) dominates practical outcomes.
- Dual coupling (inductive, capacitive) regimes coexist; environment matters.

Missing numbers
- Secondary f0 targets, topload capacitance ranges, safe k window, breakdown margins vs. altitude/humidity.

Frequency analysis
- Helical resonator with distributed parameters; harmonics and EMI footprints under non‑sinusoidal drive.

Sequences
- Tuning: estimate L,C → couple → scope primary zero‑crossing → trim topload/turns → verify under load.
- Safety: de‑energize → discharge → lockout/tagout → clearance checks.

Basic insight
- Moderate, well‑controlled coupling often outperforms aggressive k; metrology quality gates achievable performance.
