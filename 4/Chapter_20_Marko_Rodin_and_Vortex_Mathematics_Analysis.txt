CHAPTER 20: MARKO RODIN & VORTEX MATHEMATICS (PRE‑EQUATIONS) — ANALYSIS
=======================================================================

Scope note
Conceptual system (20.1), topological constructs (20.2), experimental relevance (20.3) framed as hypothesis‑generating codebook.

Interesting patterns
- Modular cycles (mod 9) suggest phase/segment coding on toroidal paths.
- Claims of preferred pathways map to impedance minimization hypotheses.

Missing numbers
- Mapping from sequence index→(θ,ϕ,path) and error bounds vs measured B‑maps; lack of quantitative benefits vs. controls.

Basic insight
- Treat sequences as candidate encodings for windings and phasing; validate with field maps, Q, and harmonic spectra.
