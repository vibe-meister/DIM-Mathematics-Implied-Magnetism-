CHAPTER 21: TESLA’S HIGH‑FREQUENCY EXPERIMENTS & THEORIES — ANALYSIS
===================================================================

Scope note
Resonant transmission (21.1), vibration/oscillation analogies (21.2), and coil networks (21.3). Mix of historical hypotheses and testable network behavior.

Interesting patterns
- Mechanical–electrical analogies as teaching and modeling tools.
- Phase‑managed coil networks scale complexity and challenge stability.

Missing numbers
- Frequency bands, ground/ionosphere models, link budgets; amplification factors and propagation losses.

Basic insight
- Prioritize measurable network behaviors and quantified environments before non‑transverse claims.
