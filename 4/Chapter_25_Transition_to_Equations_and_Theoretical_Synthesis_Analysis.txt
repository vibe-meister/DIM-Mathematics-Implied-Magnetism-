CHAPTER 25: TRANSITION TO EQUATIONS & THEORETICAL SYNTHESIS â€” ANALYSIS
=====================================================================

Scope note
Mapping (25.1), preparation (25.2), and bridging (25.3). Turns qualitative frameworks into quantitative equation sets and datasets.

Interesting patterns
- Vector/toroidal parametrization and harmonic decomposition as first steps to formalism.
- Variable/constant inventories force clarity before derivations.

Missing numbers
- Concrete parameter lists, mapping tolerances, and dataset schemas for computational analysis.

Basic insight
- Synthesis succeeds when geometry/phase choices are rendered as explicit variables and constraints; otherwise theory remains untestable.
