CHAPTER 19: VORTEX GEOMETRIES IN MAGNETIC SYSTEMS — ANALYSIS
============================================================

Scope note
Theory (19.1), experimental systems (19.2), and arrays (19.3). Priority on stability, visualization, and synchronization.

Interesting patterns
- Stability via energy minimization; pinning/depining analogies to domain walls.
- Visualization (ferrofluid/particle tracking) grounds otherwise speculative claims.

Missing numbers
- Core radii, lifetimes, field gradients for nucleation; coupling strengths and synchronization bandwidths.

Frequency analysis
- Precession/array modes; beat notes under coupling; sidebands under parametric drive.

Basic insight
- Vortices behave as phase oscillators on curved manifolds; Kuramoto‑style synchronization may model arrays.
