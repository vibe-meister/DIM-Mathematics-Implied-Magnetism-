CHAPTER 23: QUANTUM & SUBTLE ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS — ANALYSIS
=============================================================

Scope note
Anomalies (23.1), spin‑based coherence (23.2), subtle interactions (23.3). Combines formal quantum ideas with weak‑signal claims; metrology‑heavy.

Interesting patterns
- Uses coherence/entanglement language to frame low‑energy effects.
- Emphasizes detection tech (SQUID, NV, SC loops) befitting weak signals.

Missing numbers
- Energy thresholds, coherence parameters (T2), interaction strengths; reproducibility statistics.

Basic insight
- Without rigorous controls and quantified noise models, “subtle” effects are indistinguishable from artifacts.
