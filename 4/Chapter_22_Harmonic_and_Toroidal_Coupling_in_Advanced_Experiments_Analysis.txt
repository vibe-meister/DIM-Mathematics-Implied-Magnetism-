CHAPTER 22: HARMONIC & TOROIDAL COUPLING IN ADVANCED EXPERIMENTS — ANALYSIS
===========================================================================

Scope note
Coupling principles (22.1), harmonic network analysis (22.2), and applications (22.3). Frequency‑domain framing for toroidal arrays.

Interesting patterns
- Flux linkage and k framed alongside phase coherence as first‑class design variables.
- Harmonic shaping provides pathway for selective amplification and suppression.

Missing numbers
- k and M for target geometries, harmonic levels vs. frequency, transfer efficiencies; interference pattern metrics.

Basic insight
- Network‑level phase control and harmonic filtering are as vital as local coil design for efficient transfer.
