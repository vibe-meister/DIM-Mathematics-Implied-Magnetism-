Section 4 — Claims Catalog (source-grounded)

Mainstream/Procedural (as presented)
- Resonance networks, nonlinear resonance phenomena, and high‑Q experiments [PART IV Lines 3–28; Ch.17 analysis].
- Tesla coil geometry/performance factors; dual coupling; safety/metrology [PART IV Lines 29–53; Ch.18 analysis].
- Vortex geometries: stability, visualization, synchronization (as experimental program) [PART IV Lines 55–77; Ch.19 analysis].
- Harmonic/toroidal coupling: phase coherence, harmonic shaping, measurement framing [PART IV Lines 129–153; Ch.22 analysis].
- Experimental design/measurement protocols and reproducibility [PART IV Lines 179–203; Ch.24 analysis].
- Transition to equations/synthesis for Part V [PART IV Lines 205–227; Ch.25 analysis].

Hypotheses/Claims to test (as labeled/contextualized in sources)
- Rodin & vortex mathematics “pre‑equations”: modular cycles and toroidal node mapping as encoding hypotheses [PART IV Lines 79–103; Ch.20 analysis].
- Tesla longitudinal wave generation hypotheses and ground/ionosphere coupling claims [PART IV Lines 105–113; Ch.21 analysis].
- Quantum & subtle energy considerations: spin‑based coherence amplification and weak‑signal interactions (metrology‑heavy, needs controls) [PART IV Lines 155–177; Ch.23 analysis].
- Over‑unity “preliminary setups” flagged as preliminary and requiring rigorous validation [PART IV Lines 146–153].

Notes
- Inclusion mirrors source framing; no new claims added. Hypothesis items are recorded for testing only.
