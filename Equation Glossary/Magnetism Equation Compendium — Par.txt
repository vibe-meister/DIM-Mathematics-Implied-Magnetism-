✅ Usage Notes & Parameters:

Verified equations (Meissner effect, LC resonance, toroidal flux) → directly applicable to lab replication.

Created/speculative equations → model high-Q, vortex, Tesla-inspired, spin-vortex, or subtle energy systems.

Phase offsets, coupling coefficients, and coherence factors are experimentally tunable parameters.

Time constants, decay rates, and flux amplitudes require empirical calibratio
