Section 6 — Open Questions and Testable Predictions (source-derived)

Extended Frameworks — Questions [Lines 17–46, 113–219]
- Validate Meissner decay λ for materials of interest; boundary effects? Fit B(z) data to extract λ.
- Coupled oscillator parameters (γ_i, J_ij) from measurements; stability vs coupling topology.

High-Energy/Astro — Questions [Lines 230–347, 351–395]
- Under what regimes does the presented Casimir-with-B correction become measurable? Required a, B, sensitivity?
- Helicity H_m measurement in lab-scale flux tubes; uncertainty and gauge considerations.

Advanced Vortex/Topological — Questions [Lines 398–538, 679–721]
- Do Rodin sequence windings measurably alter spectra/Q vs controls across bandwidth? Required tolerances?
- Are “scalar waves” detectable under rigorous RF shielding and power accounting? Null tests?
- Can coherent P=Σ J_ij (M_i·M_j) be distinguished from classical coupling? Energy accounting thresholds?
- Is K=(μ0/2π) ln(r/a) observable for flux-tube analogs at lab scale?

Quantum-Coherent/Subtle — Questions [Lines 541–677]
- Can spin–vortex entanglement (C, E) be operationally defined/measured in proposed systems? Noise floors and decoherence times?

End.
