CHAPTER 28: ADVANCED VORTEX AND TOPOLOGICAL MODELS — ANALYSIS
==============================================================

Scope note
From Rodin‑based experimental frameworks (28.1) through exotic field manipulations (28.2) to coherent/overunity hypotheses (28.3). Balanced, evidence‑first stance recommended.

Interesting patterns
- Numeric sequences (e.g., 1,2,4,8,7,5) used as winding/phase codings; natural tie to toroidal periodicity.
- Scalar‑wave proposal adopts a standard wave operator; interpret cautiously given EM gauge structure.
- Coherent‑exchange expression P=∑ J_ij (M_i·M_j) mirrors network energy models.

Missing numbers
- No explicit winding geometries (R,r,pitch) or tolerance budgets to realize proposed patterns.
- Absent bounds on parasitics and loss to compare with conventional coils.
- No controlled experimental datasets demonstrating net advantages.

Frequency analysis
- Sequence‑coded windings imply spatial harmonics; expect distinct spectral fingerprints vs. standard windings.
- Scalar‑mode claim would require polarization/propagation tests orthogonal to transverse EM.

Sequences
- Define mapping → manufacture → blinded measurement vs. control → statistical analysis → iterate or falsify.

Entropy and randomness
- Manufacturing variance can overwhelm subtle effects; randomized trial order and blinding reduce bias.

Key length detection
- Symbolic cycle length vs. geometric closure length; mismatch produces beating/aliasing in spectra.

Basic insight
- Treat models as testable codes for geometry/phase; adopt pre‑registered protocols to avoid confirmation bias.

Feeds into later subjects
- Connects to harmonic control (Ch. 22) and quantum‑coherent proposals (Ch. 29) if evidence emerges.

Checks
- Compare harmonic content and Q against matched‑copper controls.
- Map near‑field patterns; compute discrepancy vs. predicted nodes/antinodes.

Unanswered questions
1) Which geometries, if any, yield statistically significant improvements over controls?
2) What effect sizes are plausible after accounting for parasitics and losses?
3) Can claims be reproduced by independent labs under blinded conditions?
