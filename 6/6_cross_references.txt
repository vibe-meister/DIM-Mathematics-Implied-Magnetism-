Section 6 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) Extended frameworks: superconductivity, monopole analogues, coupled magnetization [PART VI Lines 1–219]
2) High-energy/astro analogues: Ampère term, Casimir with B, helicity [PART VI Lines 221–395]
3) Advanced vortex/topological models: Rodin, scalar waves (as presented), coherent transfer [PART VI Lines 397–538]
4) Quantum-coherent/subtle: entanglement, flux networks [PART VI Lines 540–721]

Dependencies
- Superconducting/oscillator models → high-energy field relations → vortex/topology hypotheses → quantum/subtle metrics.
