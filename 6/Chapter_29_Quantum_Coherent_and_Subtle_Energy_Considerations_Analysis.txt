CHAPTER 29: QUANTUM‑COHERENT AND SUBTLE ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS — ANALYSIS
=======================================================================

Scope note
Combines spin‑vortex entanglement (29.1) with weak/"subtle" flux networks (29.2). Provides formal measures (concurrence) alongside speculative coupling expressions; demands careful metrology.

Interesting patterns
- Concurrence C and derived entanglement metric E give falsifiable targets for quantum correlations.
- Proposed K coupling uses logarithmic separation dependence typical of 2D current sheets; requires geometry care.

Missing numbers
- No decoherence times T2*, temperature ranges, or noise floors for candidate materials/sensors (NV, SQUID).
- Absent channel models linking spin and vortex degrees in real devices.

Frequency analysis
- Quantum coherence bandwidths are narrow; filtering and time‑gating essential.
- Subtle‑flux claims require differential or lock‑in detection near expected modulation frequencies.

Sequences
- State prep → entanglement protocol → tomography/measure E → vary environment → assess robustness.
- For weak flux: differential sensors → null experiments → modulation/demodulation → cross‑lab replication.

Entropy and randomness
- Decoherence sources (phonons, magnetic noise) randomize phase; shielding and dynamical decoupling mitigate.

Key length detection
- Coherence length/time are the operative keys; experiment duration must fit within T2.

Basic insight
- Without robust noise models and blinding, subtle‑flux observations risk artifact; prioritize controls and independent replication.

Feeds into later subjects
- Could interface with topological protection (Ch. 27.3) and specialized sensors from Part III.

Checks
- Report full error budgets; include negative controls.
- Compare E vs. C predictions; ensure consistency under local operations.

Unanswered questions
1) What platforms/materials deliver sufficient T2 and sensitivity for the proposed protocols?
2) What modulation/detection schemes maximize SNR while avoiding cross‑talk and EMI?
3) Which null tests rule out mundane EM pickup or thermal drift?
