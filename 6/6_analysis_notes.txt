Section 6 — Structured Notes (source-grounded)
Source: PART VI — BEYOND CLASSICAL AND EXPE.txt

Definitions/Terminology
- Superconducting Meissner decay B=B0 exp(−z/λ) [Lines 17–38, 42–46].
- Spin-ice monopole analogue charge Q_eff=±½ Σ σ_i [Lines 50–109].
- Coupled magnetization oscillators with damping γ_i, coupling J_ij [Lines 113–219].
- Ampère with displacement; Casimir with B-field; magnetic helicity H_m [Lines 230–347, 351–395].
- Rodin digital-root sequence; scalar wave (as presented); coherent energy transfer P; spin–vortex entanglement; flux-tube coupling K [Lines 398–721].

Core Equations (explicit in source)
- See 6_equations_index.txt (all items line-cited).

Cautions/Limitations
- Several items are exploratory/fringe per context (scalar waves, overunity/coherent transfer, subtle flux). Treat as hypotheses requiring strict controls.

Separation
- Mainstream/established: Meissner decay, Ampère’s law term, helicity definition, baseline Casimir formula (with correction form as presented).
- Hypotheses to test: spin-ice charge formulation; Rodin sequence usage; scalar waves; overunity/coherent P; spin–vortex entanglement metric in this context; flux-tube K form.
