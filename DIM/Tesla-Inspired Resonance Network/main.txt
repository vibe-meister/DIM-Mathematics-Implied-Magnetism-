Tesla-Inspired Resonance Network — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- V_induced(t) = − d/dt Σ_i Φ_i(t) · (1 + λ cos(θ_i(t)))

Notes:
- Phase-weighted flux sum producing induced voltage; λ scales phase modulation.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Network derivation
   - Start from coupled inductors and time-varying mutuals; derive Φ_i(t) expressions; recover the proposed V_induced under approximations; identify correction terms.
2) Phase scheduling
   - Optimize θ_i(t) schedules for target objectives (e.g., maximize |V_induced|, minimize loss); compute robustness to timing jitter and parameter drift.
3) Experimental validation
   - Build multi-coil testbed; measure induced V for programmed θ_i(t); compare to model with parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification.
