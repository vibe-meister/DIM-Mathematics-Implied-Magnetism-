High-Q Superconductor Interaction — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- B_total = Σ_{i=1}^n B_i exp(− t/τ_i) cos(ϕ_i)

Notes:
- Composite decaying modes in superconducting or high-Q environments; requires linking τ_i to material and geometry.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Material parameters and τ_i
   - Derive τ_i from Q_i and f_i; relate Q_i to surface resistance, geometry factor, and temperature; predict scaling.
2) Mode coupling
   - Include mutual coupling and detuning; derive conditions for coherent addition vs beating; compute envelope dynamics.
3) Measurement under cryogenic control
   - Specify instrumentation and calibration; extract {τ_i, ϕ_i} via ringdown and spectral fits; compare to predicted dependencies.
