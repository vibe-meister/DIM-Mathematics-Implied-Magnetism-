Inductive Coupling in Toroidal Arrays — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- M_eff = Σ_{i,j} k_ij L_i L_j

Notes:
- Effective mutual coupling across an array of toroidal inductors.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Coupling matrix construction
   - Compute k_ij from geometry using analytic approximations or FEM; assemble M matrix; analyze eigenmodes and localization.
2) Scaling laws
   - Derive M_eff scaling with spacing, orientation, and frequency; quantify impact of parasitics; provide design rules of thumb.
3) Experimental extraction
   - Measure split frequencies in coupled pairs/lattices; infer k_ij; validate predicted M_eff vs. network response.
