Toroidal Harmonic Modulation — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Weighted sensing and incomplete coverage
- Develop weighted orthonormal bases or WLS estimators for nonuniform w(θ,ϕ); derive error bounds.

2) Geometry→spectrum mapping
- Formalize mapping from winding geometry to dominant (k,m) indices; quantify leakage vs. parasitics.

3) Finite-grid effects
- Characterize bias from non-integer periodicities relative to grid; window design to mitigate leakage.

4) Time‑varying fields
- STFT parameter selection for tracking |A_{k,m}(t)| in noisy data; bounds on temporal resolution.

Tasks
- [ ] Build sampling/aliasing calculator and energy‑fraction selector for Ω.
- [ ] Implement weighted least squares coefficient estimator and validate on synthetic nonuniform data.
- [ ] Simulate geometry‑induced spectra and compare predicted vs. estimated modes.
- [ ] Draft reporting template including truncation error and validation plots.
