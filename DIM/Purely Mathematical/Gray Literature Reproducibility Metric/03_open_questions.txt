Gray Literature Reproducibility Metric — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Penalty mappings
- Calibrate u_i from effect sizes and uncertainties; define q_i for partial independence; rubric for d_i.

2) Dependence modeling
- Correlated experiments (shared labs/data); clustered bootstrap or hierarchical models.

3) Threshold design
- Choose τ_R, τ_δ, τ_ind to balance Type I/II errors; decision curves.

Tasks
- [ ] Build a penalty rubric with examples and inter‑rater agreement tests.
- [ ] Implement bootstrap and clustered bootstrap CI.
- [ ] Construct sensitivity dashboards for (α,β,γ) and influence.
