Gray Literature Reproducibility Metric — Proof Strategies

Lemma 1 (Bounds)
- Since 0≤y_i≤1 and 0≤δ_i≤1, 0≤r_i≤1 ⇒ 0≤R≤1 (and same for weighted with Σ w_i=1).

Lemma 2 (Monotonicity)
- Increasing any δ_i (holding others fixed) weakly decreases R; increasing any y_i weakly increases R.

Lemma 3 (Sensitivity to weights)
- For weighted R_w, ∂R_w/∂w_i = r_i; maximize robustness by limiting max w_i and enforcing Σ w_i=1.

Variance and CI
- Sample variance s_r² gives Var(R̂)≈s_r²/N under independence; bootstrap required if dependence suspected.

Validation
- Replicate R̂ from provided artifacts; perform sensitivity sweeps and influence diagnostics.
