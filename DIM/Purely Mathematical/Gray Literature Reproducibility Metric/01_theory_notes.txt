Gray Literature Reproducibility Metric — Theory Notes

Definition
- Experiments i=1..N with reproducibility indicator y_i∈{0,1} and penalty δ_i∈[0,1]; r_i := y_i(1−δ_i); aggregated R=(1/N)Σ r_i (or weighted R_w=Σ w_i r_i).

Penalty Components
- Uncertainty u_i (normalized error vs effect size), independence q_i (lab/shared resources), documentation d_i (data/scripts availability). Combine δ_i=αu_i+βq_i+γd_i, α+β+γ=1.

Estimation and CI
- R̂ from observed {y_i,δ_i}; Var(R̂)≈s_r²/N; bootstrap over experiments for CI and robustness to dependence.

Sensitivity
- Sweep (α,β,γ) over simplex; report R̂ ranges; influence via leave‑one‑out R̂_{−i}.

Thresholds
- Example: R̂≥τ_R with lower CI bound≥τ_R_low; median δ_i≤τ_δ; independence fraction≥τ_ind.

Reporting Schema
- For each experiment: metadata, outcomes, penalties, weights; provide raw artifacts for recomputation.
