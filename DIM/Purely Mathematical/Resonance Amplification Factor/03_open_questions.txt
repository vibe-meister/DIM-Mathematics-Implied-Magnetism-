Resonance Amplification Factor — Open Questions and Agenda

1) β calibration and universality
- Does a single β tied to Δϕ_h generalize across devices/frequencies? Map β vs. bandwidth/Q space.

2) Link to coupled‑mode theory
- Derive β from first principles for two coupled LCR resonators; quantify errors vs. exact response.

3) Jitter‑aware modeling
- Relate ε to measured σ_ϕ² rigorously; analyze bias/variance of Ĝ_res^ε under phase noise.

4) Multi‑mode extensions
- Define G_res over multiple phase offsets or distributions ρ; study aggregation rules and bounds.

5) Finite‑sample estimation
- Bias of Δϕ̂ and Q̂_eff; delta‑method corrections; bootstrap guidelines.

Tasks
- [ ] Simulate coupled resonators; fit β from half‑power points; build calibration table.
- [ ] Analyze small‑angle expansion accuracy vs. β form for typical ranges; provide error plots.
- [ ] Develop jitter‑to‑ε mapping and quantify impact on CI.
- [ ] Draft selection guidance (β vs ε vs ρ forms) with decision tree.
