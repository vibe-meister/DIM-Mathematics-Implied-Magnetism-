Magnetic Scalar Waves — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Boundary effects
- Quantify reflections/transmissions for Robin BC; energy flux accounting.

2) Inhomogeneous media
- Well‑posedness and dispersion in c(x); adiabatic invariants and caustics.

3) Damping and sources
- Energy decay rates; Green’s functions with damping; forced response.

Tasks
- [ ] Derive and verify energy identity for each BC type.
- [ ] Implement Fourier solution and compare to numerical solvers.
- [ ] Extend to damped wave and quantify decay experimentally (simulated).
