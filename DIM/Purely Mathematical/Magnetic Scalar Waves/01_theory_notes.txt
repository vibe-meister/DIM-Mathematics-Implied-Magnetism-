Magnetic Scalar Waves — Theory Notes

PDE and Parameters
- Wave equation: Φ_tt − c² ΔΦ = 0 with c=1/√(με).
- Domain Ω⊆ℝ^d, d∈{1,2,3}; initial data (Φ₀,Ψ₀) and BCs (Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin).

Solutions and Dispersion
- Plane waves: Φ=Re{A e^{i(k·x−ωt)}}, ω=c|k|; group=phase velocity=c.
- d’Alembert (1D): Φ(x,t)=F(x−ct)+G(x+ct).
- Fourier solution (ℝ^d): superposition with cos(c|k|t) and sin(c|k|t)/(c|k|).

Energy and Conservation
- Energy density e=½[(Φ_t)²+c²|∇Φ|²]; E(t)=∫ e dx; conserved for homogeneous BCs.

Well‑Posedness
- For Φ₀∈H¹, Ψ₀∈L², homogeneous admissible BCs ⇒ unique weak solution with energy conservation; stability in energy norm.

Interpretation Notes
- Treat Φ as an abstract scalar; to map to physical observables, define measurable quantities from Φ and ensure consistency with conservation and causality.

Extensions
- Inhomogeneous media: c(x), variable coefficients; use geometric optics/eikonal approximations.
- Damping: Φ_tt − c²ΔΦ + 2γΦ_t = 0; energy decays at rate ∝γ.

Reporting
- Specify Ω, BCs, initial data regularity, and solution form; include energy identity and dispersion check.
