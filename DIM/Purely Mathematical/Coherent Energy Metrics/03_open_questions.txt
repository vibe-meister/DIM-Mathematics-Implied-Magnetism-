Coherent Energy Metrics — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Coherence factor generalizations
- Define multivariate/mode-coupled coherence matrices and norms; show equivalences or dominance relations vs scalar F_coh.
- Explore frequency-resolved F_coh(f) aggregation schemes that preserve bounds and monotonicity.

2) Robust estimation
- Design circular robust estimators for F_coh under outliers and multimodal phase distributions; derive breakdown points.
- Joint estimation of (G_P, F_coh) with correlation ρ; derive CI with covariance terms.

3) Hypothesis testing beyond Rayleigh
- Compare Rayleigh, Kuiper, Watson tests for circular uniformity; set guidance by N and alternative distributions.
- Sequential testing across windows while controlling false discovery.

4) Weighted coherence theory
- Characterize bias/variance of F_coh,w under noisy weights; propose weight regularization.
- Optimize weights to minimize Var(κ̂) subject to unbiasedness.

5) Finite-sample behavior
- Exact/approximate distribution of F̂_coh for small N; tight concentration bounds.
- Bootstrap validity under dependence across runs; block bootstrap strategies.

6) Threshold design
- Calibrate F_min, κ_min, δ thresholds vs. target false positive/negative rates.
- Adaptive thresholds by SNR and N.

7) Extensions
- Define κ(f) surfaces and integrate with application-specific importance weights; prove consistency.
- Link to Kuramoto dynamics to predict F_coh from coupling and noise; validate on simulated phase oscillators.
