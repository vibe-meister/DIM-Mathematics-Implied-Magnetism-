Fringe Energy Propagation — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Model mismatch
- Effects of non‑exponential decays or chirps; robust extensions.

2) Order selection rigor
- Theoretical guarantees for AIC/BIC and stabilization under noise and short windows.

3) Sampling design
- Optimal Δt,K for given {α_n,ω_n} ranges to minimize estimator variance.

Tasks
- [ ] Implement Prony/Matrix Pencil/ESPRIT with stabilization plots.
- [ ] CRLB and bootstrap CI toolkit; compare coverage.
- [ ] Robust variants (e.g., Lp loss) for outliers and mismatch.
