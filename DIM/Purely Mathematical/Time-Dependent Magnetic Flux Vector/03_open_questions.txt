Time-Dependent Magnetic Flux Vector — Open Questions and Agenda

1) Basis design
- Identify {f_i} that minimize leakage and maximize identifiability; compare Fourier vs. Slepian vs. wavelets.

2) Jitter modeling
- Incorporate phase jitter into estimation; derive bias/variance corrections.

3) Joint estimation
- Simultaneously estimate {B0,ϕ0} and {B_i} in one LS/NLLS framework; compare performance to staged approach.

Tasks
- [ ] Leakage calculator and basis selection procedure with metrics.
- [ ] Jitter‑aware estimators and Monte Carlo validation.
- [ ] Joint estimator prototype with regularization and model selection.
