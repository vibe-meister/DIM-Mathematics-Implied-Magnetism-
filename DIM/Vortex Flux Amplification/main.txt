Vortex Flux Amplification — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- B_vortex(t) = B0 [ 1 + α sin(2π f_vortex t + ϕ) ]
- Parameters: α (amplification coefficient), f_vortex (circulation frequency)

Notes:
- Phenomenological modulation of flux amplitude associated with vortex alignment or dynamics.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Parameter estimation and bounds
   - Identify measurable B0, α, f_vortex; derive identifiability conditions from sampled B(t); compute CRLB bounds on α and f_vortex.
2) Mechanistic linkage
   - Connect α to coupling factors (k, Q, drive amplitude); derive dependence from a coupled-oscillator model; predict α(f, geometry).
3) Stability and nonlinearities
   - Extend to B0[1+α sin(...)] with saturation or Duffing nonlinearity; analyze stability, bifurcation thresholds; test predictions vs measured spectra.
