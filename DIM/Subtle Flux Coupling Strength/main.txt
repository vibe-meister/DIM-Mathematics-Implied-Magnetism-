Subtle Flux Coupling Strength — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- K_subtle = (μ0 / 2π) ln(r/a) · β_coherence

Notes:
- Logarithmic dependence suggests line-like geometry; β_coherence encodes hypothesized coherence.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Derivation from canonical fields
   - Derive ln(r/a) form from standard magnetic field integrals (e.g., long conductor); specify geometry assumptions; map β_coherence to physical parameters.
2) Regularization and domains
   - Define valid ranges for r/a; handle singularities and boundary effects; provide bounded, physical K_subtle with clear limits.
3) Measurement plan
   - Propose experiment varying r/a and coherence conditions; fit β_coherence; test whether K_subtle deviates from classical predictions beyond uncertainty.
