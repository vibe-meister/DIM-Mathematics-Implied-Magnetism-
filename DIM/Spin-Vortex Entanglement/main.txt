Spin–Vortex Entanglement — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- E_coh = ħ Σ_{i,j} J_ij S_i · S_j cos(θ_ij)

Notes:
- Hybrid concept linking spin interactions and vortex alignment; requires clear physical platform.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Model specification
   - Choose a concrete system (e.g., magnetic lattice with vortex textures); define S_i, J_ij, θ_ij; derive Hamiltonian and equations of motion; identify measurable observables.
2) Scaling laws and limits
   - Analyze E_coh scaling with system size, disorder, temperature; derive decoherence timescales and coupling thresholds for nontrivial entanglement signatures.
3) Distinguishing signatures
   - Propose measurements (e.g., MOKE, NV magnetometry) to separate spin–spin from vortex contributions; define nulls and controls; parameter inference from data.
