Phase‑Coherent Energy Transfer — Open Questions

- What reciprocity/asymmetry emerges in η_ij under practical layouts (wiring, grounds, shields)?
- How large can |η_ij| be for compact toroidal arrays before parasitic paths dominate?
- Robustness of optimal phases to Δω drift and thermal variation over multi‑hour runs?
- Do radiation/capacitive couplings meaningfully alter the inductive η_ij mapping at our target frequencies?
- What bounds on ⟨P_net⟩ follow from measured Q and source limits for our reference builds?
- Minimal phase sensing/locking hardware to ensure σ_ϕ below target tolerance?
