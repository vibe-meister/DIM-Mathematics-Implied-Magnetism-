Phase‑Coherent Energy Transfer — Identification Protocol Notes

Objective
- Estimate η_ij (or k_ij/M_ij) and Q_i; validate ⟨P_net⟩ predictions against measurements with uncertainty.

Instrumentation
- HV/RF probes or dividers matched to bandwidth; phase‑synchronized acquisition; calibrated loads; temperature/EMI control.

Procedures
1) Q measurement
   - Ringdown: excite, then measure decay; fit τ ⇒ Q=π f0 τ. Cross‑check with bandwidth method.
2) k_ij extraction (pairwise)
   - Sweep coupled pairs; record split f_±; compute k from (f_+^2 − f_-^2)/(f_+^2 + f_-^2); map to M_ij.
3) Phase sweep for η_ij
   - Program phase schedules; measure P_in/out and phases; fit ⟨P_net⟩ model to estimate η_ij; verify reciprocity within error.

Controls
- Nulls (open/short/matched dummy), swapped ground, blind passes; randomize run order; track drift.

Uncertainty
- Propagate instrument/calibration errors; bootstrap over runs; report confidence intervals for η_ij, Q, and predicted vs observed ⟨P_net⟩.

Acceptance
- Define thresholds for model fit (e.g., R^2, residual spectra); document failures and deviations.
