General Research Thoughts

- Prioritize theories nearest to classical EM for early wins (arrays, resonance factors) alongside rigorous controls.
- Normalize file/metric conventions (units, symbols, Q definitions) across DIM to avoid confusion.
- Add POSIX scripts mirroring PowerShell for crossâ€‘platform reproducibility.
- Consider a minimal JSON Schema for experiments linking DIM entries to data and citations.
