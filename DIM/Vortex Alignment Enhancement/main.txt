Vortex Alignment Enhancement — Compiled

Extracted content (created/speculative):
- B_vortex = B_toroid · (1 + β sin(θ_phase))

Notes:
- Phase-dependent modulation of toroidal field magnitude.

Three ways to complete/exhaust the math:
1) Parameter linkage
   - Express β as a function of coupling k, Q, and drive amplitude; derive bounds ensuring |β| ≤ β_max from material and geometry constraints.
2) Phase-field model
   - Define θ_phase(θ,ϕ,t) for a coil network; compute spatial average ⟨B_vortex⟩ and harmonic content vs. phase distribution; identify optimal phase patterns.
3) Measurement and validation
   - Execute controlled phase sweeps; estimate β and compare to predictions; report confidence intervals and sensitivity to detuning and losses.
