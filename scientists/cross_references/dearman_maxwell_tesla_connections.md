# Dearman–Maxwell–Tesla Connections (Cross-Reference)

## Overview
Links Dearman's implied magnetism abstractions to established Maxwellian theory and Tesla’s practice, without asserting equivalence where evidence is lacking.

## Conceptual Mappings
- Harmonic spectra H_S ↔ source/response spectra in EM or mechanical domains.
- Context kernel W_F ↔ propagation/filtering set by geometry, media, shielding (Maxwell boundary conditions, cavity modes).
- Coupling κ ↔ normalized overlap affecting energy transfer/locking (e.g., coupled resonators, injection locking).
- Chain connectivity ↔ networked coupling in lattices/arrays (antenna arrays, oscillator grids).

## Maxwell Anchors
- Resonance and energy: ω_0 = 1/√(LC), Q, Poynting S = (1/μ_0)(E×B) as energy flow; W_F captures boundary/medium effects.
- Boundary conditions: field continuity informs W_F and attainable κ in specific geometries.

## Tesla Anchors
- Loose coupling design and tuning ↔ κ control via geometry and frequency.
- High-Q resonant transfer ↔ χ̃ mapped to efficiency/voltage magnification (η, V/V_in) after calibration.

## Caution
These are analogies and tools for hypothesis testing; claims beyond standard EM require new evidence. Experiments should report nulls and bounds.
