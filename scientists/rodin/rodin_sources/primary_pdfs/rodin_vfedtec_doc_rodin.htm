                    , the vibratory essence of all that exists, is no longer on its elusive hide and seek trip -- it has been found! With the introduction of Vortex-Based Mathematics you will be able to see how energy is expressing itself mathematically. This math has no anomalies and shows the dimensional shape and function of the universe as being a toroid or donut-shaped black hole. This is the template for the universe and it is all within our base ten decimal system!

                     not merely symbols for other things. You will discover that the relationships between numbers are not random or man-made but that numbers are actually elementary particles of which everything is composed. This lost knowledge was well known to our ancients and is now being uncovered for us today. Gradually you will come to see numbers in a simple yet profoundly perfect three-dimensional matrix grid pattern that forms the shape of a torus. The number grid reveals the calibration and timing for an engine that can take us throughout the universe and solve mankind's energy needs. Interested? Delve in...

                  Mathematics as we know it today is only a tool to symbolize quantities. It simply and shamelessly helps the greedy king count his coins. Vortex-Based Mathematics (VBM) is completely different because it is a dynamic math that shows the relationships and thus the qualities of numbers rather than the quantities. Within VBM numbers are not symbols that stand for something else, NUMBERS ARE REAL AND ALIVE. But what exactly does that mean you ask, well...

                  At the age of fifteen Marko Rodin projected his mind as far as he could across the universe and asked the question, "What is the secret behind intelligence?" Due to his gift of intense focus or because it was time for him to know the answer, his stomach muscles turned to iron and as he was literally lifted forward he answered out loud, "I understand." What he had gleaned from his query was that all intelligence comes from a person's name. This led him to understand that not only do our personal names and the language they are spoken in highly affect our personalities but that the most important names are the names of God. This led Marko into a journey of thoroughly studying all the world's great religions. When he was introduced to the 
                  <B>
                    Bahai Faith
                  </B>
                   he immediately became a believer. Literally days later Marko decided to take 
                  <B>
                    The Most Great Name
                  </B>
                   of Bahaullah (prophet of the Bahai Faith) which is Abha and convert it into numbers. He did this in an effort to discover the true precise mystical intonation of The Most Great Name of God. Since the Bahai sacred scripture was originally written in Persian and Arabic Marko used the Abjad numerical notation system for this letter to number translation. This was a sacred system of allocating a unique numerical value to each letter of the 27 letters of the alphabet so that secret quantum mechanic physics could be encoded into words. What Marko discovered was that (A=1, b=2, h=5, a=1) = 9. The fact that The Most Great Name of God equaled

                    9

                   seemed very important to him as everything he had read in both the Bahai scriptures and other religious text spoke of nine being the omni-potent number. So next he drew out a circle with nine on top and 1 through 8 going around the circle clockwise. Then he discovered a very intriguing number system within this circle. Marko knew he had stumbled upon something very profound. This circle with its hidden number sequence was the "Symbol of Enlightenment." This is the

                  Follow along as the amazing properties of this symbol unveil themselves to you. Put your pencil on number 1 and without picking up your pencil, move your pencil in a straight line to number 2, then 4, then across the center to 8. Notice that you are doubling. So next should be 16 and it is, but 1+6=7. So move your pencil to 7. Then 16 doubled is 32, but 3+2=5. So move your pencil to 5. Then 32 doubled is 64 and 6+4=10 and 1+0=1. And you're back to 1. So move the pencil across the center and back up to 1. The significance of the Mayan calender is that 64 is one complete cycle of infinity. Then it begins again with 64 doubled is 128 and 1+2+8=11, then 1+1=2. And so on. You will never get off this track as you keep doubling. Notice the infinity symbol has formed underneath your pencil, creating an ever-repeating pattern of 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5. Amazingly, this number sequence stays intact as you half numbers as well. Start again at the 1 but this time go backwards on the infinity symbol. Half of 1 is .5, so move your pencil to the 5. Then half of .5 is .25, and 2+5=7. So move your pencil to the 7. And half of .25 is .125 and 1+2+5=8. So move to the 8. Next half of .125 is .0625 and 0+6+2+5=13 and 1+3=4. So go across to the 4. And half of .0625 is .03125 and 0+3+1+2+5=11 and 1+1=2. So move to the 2. Forever staying on the route of 1,2,4,8,7,5 even backwards.

                  At this point some of you might be thinking, "What in the world do these number patterns have to do with real world applications?" These number groupings piece together into a jig-saw-like puzzle pattern that perfectly demonstrates the way energy flows. Our base-ten decimal system is not man made, rather it is created by this flow of energy. Amazingly, after twenty years of working with this symbol and collaborating with engineers and scientists, Marko discovered that the 1,2,4,8,7,5 was a doubling circuit for a very efficient electrical coil. There was still one more very important number pattern to be realized. On the

                   notice how the 3, 9, and 6 is in red and does not connect at the base. That is because it is a vector. The 1,2,4,8,7,5 is the third dimension while the oscillation between the 3 and 6 demonstrates the fourth dimension, which is the higher dimensional magnetic field of an electrical coil. The 3, 9, and 6 always occur together with the 9 as the control. In fact, the Yin/Yang is not a duality but rather a trinary. This is because the 3 and 6 represent each side of the Yin/Yang and the 9 is the "S" curve between them. Everything is based on thirds. We think that the universe is based on dualities because we see the effects not the cause.

                  When I say the oscillation between the 3 and 6 what I mean is that 3 doubled is 6 and 6 doubled is 12, but 1+2=3, and then 12 doubled is 24, but 2+4=6 and 24 doubled is 48, but 4+8=12 and 1+2=3. So the 3 and 6 go back and forth in their own separate dimension. This creates the other important pattern of (3,9,6,6,9,3,3,9).

                   is the number 9. The number nine is Energy being manifested in a single moment event of occurrence in our physical world of creation. It is unique because it is the focal center by being the only number identifying with the vertical upright axis. It is the singularity or the

                  </B>
                  . The number nine never changes and is linear. For example all multiples of 9 equal 9. 9x1=9, 9x2=18, but 1+8=9, 9x3=27, but 2+7=9. This is because it is emanating in a straight line from the center of mass out of the nucleus of every atom, and from out of the singularity of a black hole. It is complete, revealing perfection, and has no parity because it always equals itself. The number nine is the missing particle in the universe known as Dark Matter.

                  The number nine lines up with the center of the infinity symbol and it is from this center that the linear emanations we call Spirit emanate from the center of mass outwards. Spirit is the only thing in the universe that moves in a straight line. Spirit is the inertia aether that Einstein postulated. Spirit is what makes everything else warp and curve around it. The perfect number patterns are actually created by this Spirit energy. Without Spirit the universe would become destitute and void. Spirit flow is the source of all movement as well as the source of the non-decaying spin of the electron.

There are nine simple multiplication series (one series for each discrete number 1-9) in Vortex-Based Mathematics. These multiplication series are based upon reducing all products to single digits via horizontal addition forming meaningful number sequences.

                  There are three polar number pairs; 1 and 8, 2 and 7, 4 and 5. For example, multiples of 4 are 1x4=4, 2x4=8, 3x4=12 but 1+2=3, 4x4=16 but 1+6=7, 5x4=20 but 2+0=2, 6x4=24 but 2+4=6, 7x4=28 but 2+8=10 and 1+0=1, 8x4=32 but 3+2=5, 9x4=36 but 3+6=9. So multiples of 4 equal 4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5 and multiples of 5, the polar opposite of 4, are (5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4). Each pair forms number sequences that are identical but in opposing directions. So if you take the multiples of 5 and look at them running backwards they are the same as the multiples of 4 running forwards. In exactly the same way the multiplication series for the polar pair [1,8] is: (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) and (8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1) for the number 1 and the number 8 respectively. The multiplication series for the polar pair [2,7] is: (2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7) and (7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2). Everything is starting from the center outwards, from the singularity.

                  Nature is expressing herself with numbers. The symmetry of our decimal system is a principle of nature. The 9 axis causes the doubling circuit and it is the point towards which matter converges and away from which it diverges or expands. Thus the polar number pairs will be mirror images of each other, both flowing in opposite directions from the central axis. There is perfect symmetry wrapped around a single point coiling outwards the way that petals are wrapped in a rose, or a nautilus shell spirals outward.

                  </B>
                   is an ancient and sacred, geometric symbol (often associated with numbers), consisting of an Isosceles Triangles overlaid by a diagonal configuration of interlocking lines. The triangle in the Enneagram is equivalent to the 9-axis and the oscillating 3-6 (see the Symbol of Enlightenment). The diagonal configuration of interlocking lines is equivalent precisely to the Doubling Circuits and the counter diagonal (antithesis Nexus Key) skin of the Abha Torus.

                    Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations, or ÏAetheronsÓ,
                  </B>
                   are linear Emanations of quasi-mass/energy, traveling in a straight line from the center of mass outwards. They radiate in phased-array from the Aeth Coalescence (the central essence of God). The Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations Rarefy the Diamond Tiles. This rarefication is spread over the Torus Skin, creating Doubling Circuits and Nested Vortices.

                   Aetherons cannot be seen or felt by the average human being. Yet, Aetherons are responsible for life as we know it. Aetherons are Life Force of the universe, and are responsible for all form and movement. Aetherons are the source of all magnetic fields and create Ïinstantly reacting, high inductance, dual magnetic field flowsÓ. Aetherons generate Synchronized Electricity. They are irresistible and can penetrate anything.

                   The Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations comprise the positive, transparent ÎZÌ axis of the Abha Torus. This is not the traditional Z-Axis of the traditional, Euclidean geometry. The transparent Z-Axis of the Abha Torus is actually a point source from which linear Emanations pour in all spherical directions from the center, as demonstrated by the Dandelion Puff Principle.

                   The Emanations activate the positive numbers of the Family Number Groups in the Map of Numbers on the Skin of the Torus. They emanate in phased-array, so that

                   (the positive members of one of the three Family Number Groups). The positive phased-array activation reticulating the Torus Skin creates Negative Draft Counterspace, the phenomenon creating the underpinning Nested Vortices.

                   The Aetheron Emanations trigger cell regeneration. Aetheron flow is the source of all movement. All mass warps around the Aetherons. All movement curves around the aetheron flow.

                   There is Aetheron emanation from the center of atomic nuclei.

                   The Emanations impart non-decaying spin to electrons. Aetheron Emanations determine angular properties of molecular and physical structure.

                   There are three arrays of aetheron Emanations. The three arrays are phased (activated) in thirds, by the three Family Number Groups.

                  <BR>
                   Aetheron Emanations are of positive Polarity. Aetherons pierce the outer skin of the torus, activating numbers of positive Polarity for one of the three Family Number Groups. Therefore, 1/6 of the total torus surface is activated by the Emanations at any one point in time. Activation of the arrays proceeds in a sequence which repeats infinitely: positive numbers of Family Number Group 2 (1/6 of torus), followed by Family Number Groups 1 and 3. Then, there is a single rest interval to complete the firing activation sequence. I-II-III, I-II-III, etc. Aetherons are the source of all movement.

                   Aetheron flow and the phenomenon of Negative Draft Counterspace creates Nested Vortices on the torus.

                   Because of the aetheron flow, these vortices are present in the gap spaces between bound matter.

The data reveal a mutual dependency between prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers, and the natural and central symmetry of prime numbers within three-dimensional objects. Botanical objects literally contain a natural prime number generating algorithm within their structural growth algorithms.

                    I just figured out a great example of how two seemingly very different points of view can be demonstrated to have not only similarity but symmetricality to the point that they are saying or expressing almost, if not totally, the same exact thing! :o)

                    Perhaps think in terms of a dialogue facilitator (or "introducer") who is in the presence of two people who are arguing violently that "their" symbol represents THE truth. It is the dialogue leader's "job" to point out, or offer questions that will bring out, awareness of ever greater levels of subtlety of what each person wants to express. The dialogue leader "should" know enough about "reality" and "truth" that they can "help" BOTH sides of any argument reach a point of "AH-HAH!" or "ah-haaahhh..." :o) 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Think about something for a moment. If the dialogue leader does not know "truth" then how can that person help other people get to the point where "they" recognize truth? There will NEVER be a "live and let live" world because of the tendency of "all elements to interact with each other to different extents and in different intensities depending upon the particular types of circumstances that exist at any particular moment."

                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Life is a "continually" evolving dynamic. Things constantly change. Conditions constantly change. There may come an expression such as "truth of the moment" or whatever. However, THE truth can be identified "in the moment" IF and only IF all people involved are open to paying attention to the particular circumstances that exist in the moment that people "choose" to start paying attention. Please notice that this has nothing to do with the past.

                    The past or "history" can be used to demonstrate "patterns" but has nothing to do with what is "now", what is truth in present time, what is the TRUTH-OF-THE-MOMENT.

                  <P ALIGN="justify">

                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    The "truth" is basically THAT WHICH CAN BE AGREED UPON. Otherwise we have to keep searching for better "examples" and better expressions of what we "think" is true. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    So, again, what are the similarities?

                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Do not both of the symbols have a circle? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Is not that circle around the outside of each symbol? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Looking at both symbols from the "outside in" from a not so nit picky not so precise point of view can we not come to an agreement then that both the wisdom of Islam and the wisdom of Christianity have "something" in common? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    This is the first step of "mediation", the first step of "healing", the first step that says, "Okay, now I can RELAAAX. I know that there is hope. I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know that there is a chance that I will learn something new here."

                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Then we move onto something that is a little less obvious. What other "pattern" do you see in both symbols? Do you each see three lines that each connect to the other two? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Is this pattern easier to see in one symbol than it is in the other symbol? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    What would you call this 3-line-pattern? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Okay, I hear that the Christian calls the pattern a triangle. The Islam calls the pattern a pyramid. Is there any similarity between the triangle and the pyramid? Can we "agree" in the similarity without arguing about what to "call" it? Can we agree that something similar can be referred to as different things? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    What good does it do to argue that something is a pyramid when what is "meant" or what is "represented" by the pyramid is similar to what a triangle means or represents? Can we not BOTH "learn" from each other's expressions of similarity? Might this not "lead" us into ever deeper meanings of pyramids and triangles? 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Okay, now we are having fun! We are seeing commonality where we once saw difference. We have now noticed TWO aspects of similarity. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    But wait! How can we agree that all that stuff in the middle of the two symbols is similar? In one symbol the lines seem spread out and "neat" whereas in the other symbol there appears to be confusion that almost looks like a star, or doorway, or... 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Well, I did not want to get too involved in this "simple" example but ideas kept coming to me as I kept writing and noticing new things. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    The connection with "Sacred Geometry" that has to do with so-called free or zero-point energy is that both of these symbols represent a "flat" view of a three dimensional object. If a person can not "see" pictures in their "mind's eye" then they may not be able to "imagine" what something might look like if "rotated" three-dimensionally. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    So it does not help to "argue" with someone who is "handicapped". That would be like going to battle against an unarmed opponent. So, we may need to identify such "incapacities" so that we can "explain" the differences in what is being perceived respectively by each participant in the dialogue. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    You see, the stuff in the middle of both symbols that is not the circle or the triangle/pyramid is the "pattern" of "something" that is "bouncing" or traveling around the inside of a "sphere". This could relate to something "like" a proton in an atom. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    I am not going to say that this is definite but the triangle/pyramid could or might (it appears to) represent "equilateral pressure" or balance. The word "pyramid" literally means "fire in the middle." So this could represent what happens when some "thing" experiences the entirety of its environment THEN something "else" happens. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Anyway, the symbol on the left might be a "front" view of the pattern and the symbol on the right might be the "left side" view thinking in terms of a three dimensional pattern. Where on the right symbol on the upper left and right sides you see short lines imagine that the lower part of those lines corresponds to the same points on the left symbol. Now, imagine that the upper parts of the lines, when rotated sideways, "cross over" to the other side of the circle/sphere. 
                  </P>
                  <P ALIGN="justify">
                    Can you see the potential that BOTH of these symbols are different views of the SAME thing looked at from different "points of view"? Or, that different points of view CAN represent EXACTLY the same thing?! 
                  </P>

                    As you know, with a four-sided pyramid both the front and left views of the pyramid are the same. I personally experienced this "in-person" when I travelled to Giza, Egypt and for some reason was permitted to go "inside" the pyramid all the way "up" to the "King's Chamber" which I have been told that not many people have been able to do. I was also offered to go "down" into some "secret" chambers however it was a tight fit (narrow) and it was dark so I chose not to do it at the time.

                    This reminds me that some Hawaiians once showed me their sacred loi's (terraced stream-fed gardens) almost as if to say, "Please help us save this sacred indigenous knowledge." The word "sacred" meaning "that which helps to remind us of deeper meanings."

                  Researchers within the various sciences tend to have their own unique way of expressing the information of their particular area of expertise. Therefore arguments tend to arise when the language or semantics of each researcher does not exactly correspond with another researcher. We have chosen to utilize the concepts of PiALOGUE as a means of enabling researchers to not only be able to communicate with each other but also to be able to come up with better expressions of what it is that they are attempting to communicate so that a common level language is achieved.

                  PiALOGUE is a disambiguation communication process that enables people to reach ever greater levels of common understanding and awareness. PiALOGUE is written in ALL CAPS except for the lower case "i" to distinguish the word Pi as part of Pi Dialogue which became PiALOGUE. PiALOGUE began as an off-shoot of Bohm Dialogue or Dialogue in the Spirit of Bohm. Proponents of Bohm Dialogue prefer a form of free association conducted in groups, with no predefined purpose in mind other than mutual understanding and exploration of human thought with the aim to allow participants to examine their preconceptions, prejudices, and patterns of thought. PiALOGUE on the other hand has a purpose of triangulating or converging upon commonality where the participants endeavor to not only understand each other but to communicate their own knowledge and awareness with ever greater effectiveness for the people with whom they are in dialogue. PiALOGUE enables ever greater understanding of what is actual as opposed to what might only appear to be real or potentially illusionary. As the symbol Pi represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, as a means of finding the area of a circle or sphere, PiALOGUE is a process to determine the totality of what is or what can be known and/or understood similarly to using Pi along with measurable elements to compute the total area contained within a circle or sphere. The further out that you carry the non-ending decimal digits of Pi with your calculations the greater your level of accuracy. With PiALOGUE the longer that you participate, combining what you know or think that you know along with that which you learn or receive from other people, the more accurate (and practically useful) your own knowledge and awareness will become. In PiALOGUE terms, Enlightenment is an on-going process. PiALOGUE has an equation which is X -&gt; 0 or as X approaches zero which refers to as a person's dysfunctional or less-than-optimal thought processes or emotional reactivity approaches zero or becomes less and less thereby enabling a person's genius to become more and more. A person realizes their own genius to a greater and greater extent to the point where they can understand another person or group's point-of-view well enough to communicate their genius to that specific person or group of people in the person or group's own form or style of language. PiALOGUE recognizes that true genius has its own internal language that facilitates genius for that specific person. The challenge is for each genius to figure out how to communicate that genius to and with other people on gradually lower and lower levels of intellectual capability in order to communicate with as many people as possible in each moment or as necessary.
