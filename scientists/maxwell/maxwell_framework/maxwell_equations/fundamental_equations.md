# Maxwell's Equations - Fundamental Forms

## Differential Form (Local)

### 1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields
```
∇ · E = ρ/ε₀
```
- **Physical meaning**: Electric field divergence equals charge density
- **Tesla application**: Understanding charge distribution on coil surfaces

### 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
```
∇ · B = 0
```
- **Physical meaning**: No magnetic monopoles exist
- **Tesla application**: Magnetic field lines form closed loops in coils

### 3. Faraday's Law of Induction
```
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t
```
- **Physical meaning**: Changing magnetic field creates electric field
- **Tesla application**: Primary-secondary coupling mechanism

### 4. Ampère-Maxwell Law
```
∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀(∂E/∂t)
```
- **Physical meaning**: Current and changing electric field create magnetic field
- **Tesla application**: High-frequency current flow in Tesla coils

## Integral Form (Global)

### 1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields
```
∮ E · dA = Q_enclosed/ε₀
```

### 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
```
∮ B · dA = 0
```

### 3. Faraday's Law of Induction
```
∮ E · dl = -d/dt(∮ B · dA)
```

### 4. Ampère-Maxwell Law
```
∮ B · dl = μ₀I_enclosed + μ₀ε₀(d/dt)(∮ E · dA)
```
