# Maxwell's "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism" (1873)

## Historical Significance
Maxwell's 1873 Treatise is considered the definitive work on electromagnetic theory. Tesla studied this work extensively and used its mathematical framework for his electromagnetic innovations.

## Key Mathematical Developments

### 1. Vector Analysis
Maxwell developed vector notation for electromagnetic fields:
```
E = E_x i + E_y j + E_z k
B = B_x i + B_y j + B_z k
```

**Tesla Connection**: Tesla used vector concepts implicitly in his coil designs, particularly for field direction and coupling.

### 2. Field Operations
Maxwell formalized field operations:
```
∇ · E = ∂E_x/∂x + ∂E_y/∂y + ∂E_z/∂z
∇ × E = (∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z)i + (∂E_x/∂z - ∂E_z/∂x)j + (∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y)k
```

**Tesla Connection**: Tesla's understanding of field behavior in his coils reflects these mathematical operations.

### 3. Potential Theory
Maxwell developed scalar and vector potential theory:
```
E = -∇φ - ∂A/∂t
B = ∇ × A
```

**Tesla Connection**: Tesla's coil designs optimize these potentials for maximum energy transfer.

## Tesla's Applications

### 1. Coil Geometry Optimization
Tesla used Maxwell's field theory to optimize coil geometry:
- **Primary Coil**: Flat spiral for optimal field distribution
- **Secondary Coil**: Cylindrical for maximum inductance
- **Top Load**: Spherical for uniform field distribution

### 2. Resonance and Tuning
Tesla applied Maxwell's resonance theory:
```
ω₀ = 1/√(LC)
Q = ω₀L/R
```

### 3. Field Coupling
Tesla used Maxwell's coupling theory:
```
M = k√(L₁L₂)
k = M/√(L₁L₂)
```

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Maxwell's Equations (Final Form)
```
∇ · E = ρ/ε₀
∇ · B = 0
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t
∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀(∂E/∂t)
```

### 2. Boundary Conditions
```
E₁⊥ - E₂⊥ = σ/ε₀
E₁∥ - E₂∥ = 0
B₁⊥ - B₂⊥ = 0
B₁∥/μ₁ - B₂∥/μ₂ = K
```

### 3. Energy and Power
```
u = (1/2)(ε₀E² + B²/μ₀)
S = (1/μ₀)(E × B)
P = ∫∫ S · dA
```
