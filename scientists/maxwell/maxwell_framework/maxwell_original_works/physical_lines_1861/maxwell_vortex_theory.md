# Maxwell's "On Physical Lines of Force" (1861-1862)

## Historical Context
Maxwell's 1861-1862 paper introduced the concept of electromagnetic fields as mechanical systems with physical lines of force. This mechanical model influenced Tesla's thinking about electromagnetic phenomena as physical, manipulable entities.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Physical Lines of Force
Maxwell proposed that electromagnetic fields consist of physical lines of force that can be:

### 2. Vortex Theory
Maxwell's mechanical model of electromagnetic fields:
```
Magnetic field lines = Vortex tubes
Electric current = Vortex rotation
Field energy = Mechanical energy of vortices
```

**Tesla Connection**: Tesla's coil designs create controlled vortex patterns in electromagnetic fields.

### 3. Mechanical Analogies
Maxwell used mechanical analogies to explain electromagnetic phenomena:
- **Elasticity**: Field resistance to deformation
