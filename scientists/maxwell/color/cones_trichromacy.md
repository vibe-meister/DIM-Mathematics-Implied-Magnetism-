# Cones, Young–Helmholtz Trichromacy, and Maxwell

## Physiological Basis
- Human vision: three cone classes (L, M, S)
- Peak sensitivities (approx.): L≈560–565 nm, M≈530–535 nm, S≈420–440 nm
- Cone response vector: R = [L, M, S]^T

## Young–Helmholtz Theory (Pre-Maxwell, refined in Maxwell’s era)
- Any color can be matched by additive mixture of three primaries
- Maxwell performed quantitative matching linking primaries to cone-like responses

## Color Matching Functions (CMFs)
- For chosen primaries P = (R,G,B): any spectrum S(λ) maps via
  C = ∫ S(λ) p(λ) dλ, with p(λ) = [p_R(λ), p_G(λ), p_B(λ)]
- Maxwell reported negative matches (requiring primary added to test field) → evidence of non-orthogonal primaries and opponent regions

## Linear Model
- Tristimulus vector T = M · R where M maps cone space to chosen primaries
- Metamerism: different spectra with identical T

## Perceptual Links
- Chromaticity from normalized tristimulus: r = R/(R+G+B), g = G/(R+G+B)
- Maxwell triangle visualizes these normalized coordinates

## Notes
- Maxwell helped operationalize trichromacy with precise experimental protocols
- His work preceded CIE 1931 XYZ but provided core methodology
