# Maxwell on Color, Cones, and Trichromacy

## Overview
Maxwell made seminal contributions to color science, including trichromatic color matching, the Maxwell triangle, the color top, and the first color photograph (1861). His work connects physiological cone responses to physical color mixtures and perceptual color spaces.
