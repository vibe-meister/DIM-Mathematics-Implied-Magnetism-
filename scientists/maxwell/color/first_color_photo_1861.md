# Maxwellâ€™s First Color Photograph (1861)

## Experiment
- Subject: Tartan ribbon.
- Method: Three monochrome photographs through red, green, blue filters.
- Reconstruction: Project each image through the same filter colors and superimpose.

## Significance
- First demonstration of additive trichromatic reproduction.
- Empirical support for trichromacy and linear color mixing.

## Practical Challenges
- Filters and emulsions had unequal spectral sensitivity (blue-sensitive plates).
- Registration and illumination required care.

## Legacy
- Foundation for RGB imaging systems and additive displays.
