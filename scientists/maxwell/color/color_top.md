# Maxwell Color Top and Disc Mixing

## Apparatus
- Rotating top with sectors of different colored papers (e.g., red, green, blue, white, black).
- At sufficient speed, temporal averaging yields perceived additive mixture.

## Method
- Set sector angles α_i for colors i.
- Predicted mixture (linear in luminance): T ∝ Σ α_i T_i.
- Adjust α_i until target match achieved; record proportions.

## Insights
- Demonstrates linearity of additive color mixing (within limits).
- Enabled early quantification of mixture ratios and matching functions.

## Limitations
- Depends on reflectance, illumination spectrum, and observer adaptation.
- Luminance-weighted mixing; nonlinearity near extremes and for saturated hues.

## Relation to Maxwell Triangle
- Sector proportions map to barycentric coordinates inside triangle.
