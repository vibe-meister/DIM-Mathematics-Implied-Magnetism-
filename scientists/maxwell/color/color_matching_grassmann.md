# Color Matching Experiments and Grassmann’s Laws

## Maxwell’s Matching Protocols
- Split-field photometric matches using three primary sources.
- Allow primaries on either side (negative components handled by adding to test field).
- Record primary amounts yielding visual equality.

## Grassmann’s Laws (as operational foundations)
1. Additivity: matches remain matches after addition of same color to both sides.
2. Homogeneity: scaling intensities scales matches.
3. Trichromacy: three appropriately chosen primaries suffice (for normal observers).

## Mathematical Form
- Tristimulus T = (R,G,B) is linear in spectral power S(λ): T = ∫ S(λ) p(λ) dλ.
- Chromaticity from normalized T; luminance from weighted sum.

## Negative Lobes
- Some CMFs include negative regions → necessity of adding a primary to test field during matching.

## Toward CIE XYZ
- Maxwell’s framework led to standardized observers and CIE 1931 XYZ via linear transforms of RGB.
