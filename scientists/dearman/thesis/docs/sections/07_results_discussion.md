Results and Discussion
----------------------

Findings
--------
- Simulations confirm nonzero magnetization across χ values spanning 10^−6 to 10^0.
- Curie–Weiss trends reproduce expected paramagnetic temperature dependence above ordering.
- Dataset compilation indicates everyday materials (water, Al, Cu) show measurable but weak responses.
- Statistical test: Weighted-mean z-test and Bayes factor on water χ measurements decisively support χ ≠ 0 (see `chi_significance_test.py` output).
- Predictions: chi(T) illustrations for O2 (Curie) and Fe above Tc (Curie–Weiss) show expected monotonic trends consistent with theory.

Implications
------------
- Engineering: tuning χ via alloying, temperature, and microstructure.
- Medicine: implications for MRI safety and contrast; diamagnetic tissues experience forces in strong gradients.
- Energy: magnetic bearings and levitation concepts leverage diamagnetism/flux shaping.

Limitations
-----------
- Weak-signal detection requires careful calibration; stray fields and gradients confound measurements.
- Nanoscale and quantum size effects not modeled here; hysteresis in ferro/ferri introduces nonlinearity.
