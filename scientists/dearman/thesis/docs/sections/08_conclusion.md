Conclusion and Future Work
--------------------------

We argued that magnetism is universal: χ is nonzero for all materials, with sign and magnitude dictated by electron structure and many-body interactions. Experiments and simulations support the claim, and the literature corroborates both weak and strong responses.

Future Work
-----------
- Extend measurements across temperature ranges and microstructures.
- Incorporate FEM field modeling and domain-level simulations.
- Investigate advanced field geometries and materials systems within established electrodynamics.

Limitations and Falsifiability
------------------------------
- Detection Bounds: Our operational claim (“no truly non‑magnetic materials”) is only as strong as the predefined detection threshold. Failure to detect |χ| above a specified bound (e.g., 10^−8 under calibrated H, T, geometry) is a valid non‑confirmation for those conditions.
- Model Scope: The κ‑overlap formalism is a design/analysis tool; it does not replace microscopic Hamiltonians. Its predictions hinge on accurate spectra H and context weights W.
- Spin Dynamics Assumptions: Bloch parameters (T1, T2) and field homogeneity (B0, B1) constrain ESR/NMR inferences; miscalibration or inhomogeneity can mimic amplitude/linewidth effects.
- Falsifiable Tests: (i) ESR/NMR amplitude failing to scale with κ at fixed B0; (ii) resonance positions not following ω_res ≈ γ B0; (iii) SQUID/fluxgate signals uncorrelated with κ modulation under controlled shielding. Any of these outcomes refute specific DIM predictions.
