Conclusion and Future Work
--------------------------

We argued that magnetism is universal: Ï‡ is nonzero for all materials, with sign and magnitude dictated by electron structure and many-body interactions. Experiments and simulations support the claim, and the literature corroborates both weak and strong responses.

Future Work
-----------
- Extend measurements across temperature ranges and microstructures.
- Incorporate FEM field modeling and domain-level simulations.
- Investigate advanced field geometries and materials systems within established electrodynamics.
