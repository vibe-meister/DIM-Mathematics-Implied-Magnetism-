Literature Review

Scope and Typology
------------------
We survey classical and quantum treatments of magnetism, organizing by response type [Jackson 1998; Kittel 2005]. The following table summarizes canonical categories (values indicative; temperature and purity dependent) [Bozorth 1993; Selwood 1956]:

| Type             | Susceptibility χ       | Response                  | Examples                 | Key Mechanism                                  |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Diamagnetic      | χ < 0 (weak)           | Repulsion                 | Water, Cu, Bi            | Induced orbital currents oppose field         |
| Paramagnetic     | χ > 0 (weak)           | Attraction                | Al, O2                   | Unpaired spins partially align                |
| Ferromagnetic    | χ > 0 (strong)         | Strong attraction, memory | Fe, Ni, Co               | Exchange-driven domain alignment              |
| Ferrimagnetic    | χ > 0 (moderate)       | Attraction, memory        | Fe3O4                    | Unequal opposing sublattice moments           |
| Antiferromagnetic| ~0 (net)               | Minimal net magnetization | Cr, MnO                  | Equal opposing sublattice moments             |

Key Theoretical Milestones
--------------------------
- Classical electrodynamics (Maxwell): fields from moving charges; constitutive relation M = χH [Jackson 1998].
- Langevin paramagnetism; Curie and Curie–Weiss laws [Curie 1895; Weiss 1907].
- Quantum mechanics: spin, Pauli exclusion, Hund’s rules; exchange interaction (Heisenberg model) enabling ferro-/antiferromagnetism [Kittel 2005].
- Band theory and itinerant magnetism; Stoner criterion [Ashcroft & Mermin 1976].
- Modern many-body approaches: spin waves, mean-field, DFT [Kittel 2005].

Empirical Studies and Measurements
----------------------------------
- Susceptibility of common materials (water χ ≈ −9 × 10^−6; Al ≈ +2.2 × 10^−5) via Gouy/Evans balances [Selwood 1956].
- Temperature dependence: Curie–Weiss behavior above ordering temperature; deviations near critical points.
- Microstructure effects: grain size, defects, and anisotropy shaping domain behavior.

Gaps and Emphases
-----------------
Introductory treatments overemphasize ferromagnets while neglecting omnipresent diamagnetism. We emphasize universality: χ ≠ 0 in matter, with magnitude set by electronic structure.

Positioning DIM Relative to Prior Work
--------------------------------------
- κ-Overlap vs. Traditional Models: Standard texts quantify χ and magnetization but do not provide a tunable spectral/context overlap scalar that directly links source spectra and geometry to response magnitude. DIM’s κ fills this operational gap by guiding experimental design and falsification.
- Spin Integration: ESR/NMR phenomenology is well-established, but DIM’s novelty is to embed κ into the drive–response chain (B1_eff ∝ κ), predicting amplitude scaling with κ while preserving ω_res ≈ γ B0 and T1/T2 interpretations.
- Decision Mapping: While torque magnetometry and susceptibility measurements quantify signals, DIM adds a simple decision map T(χ̃) to connect microscopic susceptibilities to macroscopic outcomes (e.g., deflection thresholds), making “implied” effects testable.
- Scope Control: DIM adheres to classical EM and quantum spin physics, distinguishing it from fringe “vibration” or zero‑point claims by restricting to falsifiable, instrument‑calibrated predictions.
