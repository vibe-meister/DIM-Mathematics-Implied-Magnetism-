Magnetism Is Universal: An Implied and Quantitative Synthesis

This thesis advances the claim that all materials exhibit magnetism, with measured responses spanning diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and antiferromagnetism. We marshal experimental demonstrations (e.g., diamagnetic levitation and susceptibility measurements) and theoretical foundations from Maxwell’s equations and quantum mechanics—especially spin statistics and exchange interactions—to show that apparent "non-magnetism" is a mischaracterization of weak but real responses (χ ≠ 0) [Jackson 1998; Kittel 2005]. We present a unified framework linking macroscopic magnetization M = χH to microscopic electron structure, supplementing the analysis with simulations and a curated dataset of susceptibilities across common materials [Bozorth 1993; Selwood 1956]. The work outlines accessible experimental protocols, summarizes limitations (temperature, microstructure, finite-size effects), and highlights implications for materials engineering, medical imaging, and energy applications [Berry & Geim 1997].

Contributions (Claims of Novelty): We (i) introduce a κ‑overlap formalism that operationalizes source–system compatibility and guides falsifiable experiments; (ii) integrate this with spin/precession dynamics via Bloch equations to produce concrete ESR/NMR predictions (ω_res ≈ γ B0, amplitude ∝ κ, linewidth ↔ T2); (iii) decompose susceptibility (χ_dia, χ_Pauli, χ_local) and map it through a simple decision function to macroscopic observables (e.g., torque/deflection); and (iv) pre‑register protocols (ESR/NMR/SQUID) and detection thresholds that permit clear falsification of the implied‑magnetism claim under specified conditions.
