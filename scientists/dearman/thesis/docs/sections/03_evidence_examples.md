Evidence and Examples
---------------------

Experimental Proof
------------------
- Diamagnetic levitation: pyrolytic graphite over a Halbach array; frogs or strawberries in multi-tesla fields. Repulsion confirms χ < 0 [Berry & Geim 1997].
- Susceptibility measurements: Gouy or Evans balance detects tiny forces; water’s χ ≈ −9 × 10^−6 [Selwood 1956].

Theoretical Basis
-----------------
- Maxwell to quantum: magnetic fields arise from moving charges; magnetization emerges from spin and orbital angular momentum [Jackson 1998; Kittel 2005].
- Pauli exclusion and Hund’s rule yield unpaired spins and exchange interactions, explaining paramagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering.

Counterexamples?
----------------
There are no truly "non-magnetic" materials. Diamagnetism is universal in matter; even when χ is near zero, it is not exactly zero. Vacuum fluctuations are beyond this scope but underscore that fields permeate all space.

Typology of Magnetic Responses
------------------------------
The table is expanded in the Literature Review; brief overview:

- Diamagnetic: χ < 0 (weak), field repulsion (e.g., water, copper, bismuth); induced orbital currents oppose applied field.
- Paramagnetic: χ > 0 (weak), field attraction (e.g., aluminum, O2); random spins partially align with field.
- Ferromagnetic: χ > 0 (strong), domains align, remanence (Fe, Ni, Co).
- Ferrimagnetic: χ > 0 (moderate), unequal opposing sublattice spins (Fe3O4).
- Antiferromagnetic: net near zero at low field (Cr, MnO); equal opposing spins.
