Gouy Balance Susceptibility Measurement
--------------------------------------

Overview
--------
Measure magnetic susceptibility χ from the force on a sample in a field gradient.

Apparatus
---------
- Permanent magnet with known field gradient or an electromagnet
- Analytical balance (mg precision)
- Sample holders (quartz tubes for liquids/solids)
- Ruler/laser pointer for alignment

Procedure
---------
1. Tare the balance with the sample positioned far from the field.
2. Insert the sample into the uniform gradient region; record apparent mass change Δm.
3. Repeat for multiple positions and orientations; average readings.
4. Compute χ via standard Gouy relation using Δm, field gradient, and sample geometry.

Uncertainty
-----------
- Account for buoyancy, alignment, temperature drift, and gradient calibration.
