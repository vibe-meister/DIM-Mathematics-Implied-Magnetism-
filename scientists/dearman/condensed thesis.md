### Condensed Thesis: DeArman Implied Magnetism (DIM) with Spin Inference

Abstract (≈220 words)
DeArman Implied Magnetism (DIM) advances a spin-centric account of magnetic universality: all matter exhibits magnetism because all matter hosts electrons with spin and orbital motion. The specific magnetic response—diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic—emerges from how spins populate and align within a material’s electronic structure and how those populations are thermally distributed by state (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). DIM formalizes this intuition with standard relations: magnetization M = χH; spin magnetic moment per center μ ≈ g μ_B √[S(S+1)]/√3 for paramagnetic regimes; Curie and Curie–Weiss scaling χ ∝ 1/T for dilute localized moments; and state-modulating factors that adjust alignment probabilities. We provide simulations and analyses spanning solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas to show that spin inference predicts weak but measurable diamagnetism across states, while strong order (e.g., ferromagnetism) requires solid-state exchange and domain formation. Empirical anchors include susceptibility values for representative materials, ESR/ESR-like spin probes, and temperature scans illustrating χ(T). DIM’s contribution is a unifying, actionable framework that centers spin as the root cause across regimes, clarifies why “non-magnetic” is a misnomer, and offers a practical mapping from state and composition to magnetic response. Applications include materials selection, metrology under strong fields, and design spaces where small χ still matters (precision force, levitation, and separation technologies).

Introduction (essentials)
- Thesis: DIM infers universal magnetism from electron spin/orbital motion; magnitude and sign depend on material and state.
- Motivation: contrast spin-flip alignment in gases vs. domain alignment in solids; show everyday weak-χ effects are measurable.
- Objectives: quantify χ across states; relate spin statistics to macroscopic response; provide reproducible analysis.

Literature Review (essentials)
- Spin foundations: Stern–Gerlach; ESR/EPR; Curie/Curie–Weiss.
- State dependence: ordering in solids; randomized spins in liquids; partial alignment in gases; plasmas with free spins.
- Gap: spin-centric synthesis across states; DIM supplies a unified inference model.

Theoretical Framework (key pieces)
- Magnetization: \( M = \chi H \); \( B = \mu_0(H + M) \).
- Spin moment (paramagnets): \( \mu \approx g\,\mu_B\,\sqrt{S(S+1)}/\sqrt{3} \).
- Curie law (dilute moments): \( \chi = C/T \); Curie–Weiss: \( \chi = C/(T - \Theta) \).
- State modifiers: alignment probabilities via Boltzmann factors; density/ionization in plasmas; exchange-driven order in solids.

Methodology (brief)
- Simulations: parametric \( \chi(H,T) \); Curie–Weiss scans; density-matrix mixing for liquids.
- Analysis: compare predicted vs. tabulated χ for solids/liquids/gases/plasmas; use ESR where available.

Results and Discussion (high-level)
- Findings: diamagnetism across states; strong order limited to solids with suitable exchange.
- Spin-based quick map by state/material:
  - Solid (Fe): aligned domains → ferromagnetic (χ ~ 10^3).
  - Liquid (Hg): randomized spins → diamagnetic (χ ≈ −3.3×10^−5).
  - Gas (O2): partial alignment → paramagnetic (χ ≈ +1.9×10^−6).
  - Plasma (ionized H): free spins; effective response set by density/temperature (typically diamagnetic in bulk).

Conclusion (concise)
- Reaffirm DIM’s spin-centric universality and the state/material map to χ.
- Next steps: extend χ(T) datasets across states; deepen spin–state simulations; include solid-state exchange models for domain behavior.
