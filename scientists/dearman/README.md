# Dearman Theory of Universal Magnetism

Dearman proposes that everything possesses some form of magnetism. The core rationale is that harmonic frequencies in matter and energy can resonate, synchronize, and couple within a shared field structure, producing attraction and organization.

## Core ideas
- Ubiquitous magnetism: every system exhibits a magnetic component or response.
- Harmonics and resonance: systems emit or respond to spectra of frequencies; when spectra are commensurate, coupling strengthens.
- Field structure: interactions occur within shared field structures that mediate attraction/repulsion and energy exchange.
- Predictive angle: alignment of harmonic spectra is hypothesized to correlate with interaction strength.

## Terms
- Harmonics: integer-related frequency components of a system's oscillation.
- Resonance: amplification when a system is driven near its natural frequencies.
- Field structure: the spatial organization of fields (e.g., electromagnetic) through which interactions propagate.

## Notes
- This is a hypothesis and is not established mainstream physics; it requires formal definitions, mathematics, and reproducible experiments.
- Future work: specify measurable quantities, derive testable predictions, and propose experimental setups (e.g., spectral matching and measured changes in force or alignment).
