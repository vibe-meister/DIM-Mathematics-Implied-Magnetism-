# Rules

Setup
- Shuffle object cards and deal 5 to each player.

Turn
1) Play 1 object card to the table or swap 1 from your hand.
2) Optionally add a Field Context card affecting all sets this round.
3) Score coupling for your visible set:
   - +2 for each harmonic overlap (within 5% of target band)
   - +1 for near-match (within 12%)
   - -1 for strong mismatch (beyond 25%)
   - +1 if material compatibility tag matches (e.g., ferromagnetic/paramagnetic)
   - -1 if field sensitivity conflicts with context (e.g., high noise)
4) Draw 1 card.

End of round
- After each players turn, highest scorer this round takes a Bonus Token.

Win condition
