# Thought-Experiment: Universal Magnetism Game

Purpose: teach that many systems can exhibit magnetic-like interactions when their frequencies align (harmonize) within a shared field structure.

How it works (at a glance)
- Players choose objects/systems cards with basic properties: frequency bands, material type, and field sensitivity.
- Rounds simulate interactions by checking harmonic overlaps and field context.
- Matching or near-matching bands increase coupling score; mismatches reduce it.
- The goal is to assemble sets that maximize total coupling (organization/attraction).

Educational outcomes
- Recognize harmonics/resonance as a general phenomenon.
- See how alignment can strengthen interactions.
- Distinguish established physics from hypothesis (this is a conceptual learning tool).
