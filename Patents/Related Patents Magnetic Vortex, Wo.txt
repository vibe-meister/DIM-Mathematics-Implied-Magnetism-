Notes

Themes and Connections: All patents emphasize EM/magnetic fields for propulsion without mass ejection, often invoking negative mass/energy, resonance (e.g., real ω from negative K/M), and hyperspace as an aether-analog for energy. St. Clair's work forms a "family" of applications, many abandoned but influential in alternative physics.
Data Sources: Compiled from Google Patents, USPTO via web searches, and direct page analyses. No active citations to US20030197093A1, but cross-references abound (e.g., St. Clair's filings cite each other).
Limitations: Fringe nature means many are abandoned/unexamined; global databases (e.g., CN, JP) may have translations. For full texts/diagrams, search patents.google.com.
