CHAPTER 6: RESONANCE, OSCILLATIONS, AND TOROIDAL LC SYSTEMS — ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Scope note
Builds on Ch. 5 by introducing LC resonance, coupled oscillators, and Q. Distinct toroidal context: flux closure elevates Q and reduces radiation.

Interesting patterns
- Dual Q expressions (Q=ω0L/R and Q=1/R·√(L/C)) appear implicitly via earlier equations; invites cross‑checks.
- Emphasis on phase synchronization suggests PLL or injection‑locking strategies for arrays.

Missing numbers
- No target Q ranges (e.g., 50, 200, 1000) for specified materials/geometries.
- Absent parasitic C, inter‑turn capacitance, and ESR data needed for accurate f0.

Frequency analysis
- Toroids: reduced fringing lowers radiation loss; expect narrower bandwidth B=f0/Q vs. solenoids.
- Coupled LC: mode splitting visible; amplitude ratio across f± reveals k.

Sequences
- Tuning: cold estimate → swept drive → observe current minima/maxima → adjust coupling and topload/turns → re‑measure.
- Stability: small‑signal ring‑down → large‑signal compression → observe onset of nonlinearity.

Structural patterns
- Moves ideal → coupled → networked arrays; math remains minimal but testable.

Entropy and randomness
- Thermal drift and supply jitter broaden the resonance line; Allan deviation framing recommended for long runs.

Key length detection
- Natural key = beat period 1/|f+−f−|; use to detect weak coupling in time domain.

Basic insight
- High‑Q advantage is only realized if coupling, parasitics, and drift are simultaneously controlled; toroids help but do not guarantee performance.

Feeds later subjects
- Sets the stage for Ch. 10 harmonics and Ch. 22 harmonic control; informs metrology choices in Ch. 13.

Concrete checks
- Ring‑down Q vs. −3 dB bandwidth; require agreement within 10%.
- Extract k from splitting; verify with geometric M estimate.
- Temperature coefficient measurement of f0; compute compensation needed.

Unanswered questions
1) What Q is feasible with the wire/core specified elsewhere?
2) How large are parasitic C and ESR at the intended ω, and how do they vary with temperature?
3) What coupling k maximizes transfer without over‑damping in the target application?
4) How does toroid geometry (cross‑section, mean radius) trade off between L, Cp, and loss?
5) What stabilization method (PLL, AFC, injection lock) is planned for long‑term coherence?
