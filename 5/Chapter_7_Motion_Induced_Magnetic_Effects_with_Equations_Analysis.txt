CHAPTER 7: MOTION‑INDUCED MAGNETIC EFFECTS WITH EQUATIONS — ANALYSIS
===================================================================

Scope note
Extends induction to moving conductors/magnets: Lorentz force, torque, electromechanical conversion, and flux pumping. Bridges to rotating machines and levitation.

Interesting patterns
- Clear mapping from F=q(v×B) and τ=m×B to device‑level quantities (back‑EMF, torque curves).
- Mentions flux pumping and vortex alignment, implying non‑steady effects and possible parametric gain.

Missing numbers
- No numeric B fields, speeds v, or geometries to compute forces/EMF.
- Absent frictional/eddy drag models for realistic efficiency estimates.

Frequency analysis
- Back‑EMF ∝ ω in rotating machines; interplay with coil impedance sets operating point.
- Periodic motion introduces sidebands and potential parametric excitation at multiples of rotation.

Sequences
- Generator: mechanical input → flux linkage modulation → EMF → load → back‑torque.
- Motor: drive current → force/torque → acceleration → back‑EMF limiting → steady state.

Entropy and randomness
- Load fluctuations and cogging introduce randomness in torque ripple; noise spectra inform mechanical filtering needs.

Key length detection
- Mechanical key: pole pitch/circumference sets electromagnetic spatial period; electrical key: commutation timing or inverter switching period.

Basic insight
- Efficiency hinges on matching electrical and mechanical impedances; any vortex/flux‑pumping concepts must beat baseline machine metrics.

Feeds later subjects
- Supports Ch. 16 (applications) and provides counterexamples to fringe claims unless quantitatively superior.

Checks
- Compute induced EMF for given B, v, length; validate against measured waveforms.
- Torque constant kT vs. back‑EMF constant kE equality check in SI units.

Unanswered questions
1) What are the intended operating B, v/ω, and dimensions for quantitative predictions?
2) How large are eddy losses and mechanical drag in proposed geometries?
3) Can flux pumping exceed conventional machine gains within thermal limits?
