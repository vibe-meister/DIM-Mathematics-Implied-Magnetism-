CHAPTER 8: TOPOLOGY, VORTEX MATH, AND RODIN TOROIDAL FRAMEWORK — ANALYSIS
=========================================================================

Scope note
Connects formal toroidal parameterization to vortex number mapping and proposes coil/winding trajectories consistent with those mappings.

Interesting patterns
- Explicit toroidal coordinates (x,y,z) indicate intent to simulate actual paths; not merely conceptual.
- V(n)=n mod 9 mapping hints at phase/segment coding for windings.

Missing numbers
- No concrete (R, r), wire spacing, or dielectric data to resolve Cp and proximity effects.
- Absent error metrics comparing predicted vs. measured B(θ,ϕ).

Frequency analysis
- B(θ,ϕ)=B0 cos(kθ+ϕ) implies spatial harmonics; drive can select/weight modes.
- Coupled vortex energy transfer P=I·Eind suggests dependence on dA/dt path control.

Sequences
- Define mapping → generate winding → excite with phase schedule → measure field/uniformity → iterate.

Structural patterns
- Mathematics → mapping → experiment pipeline aligns with Part V’s quantitative goals.

Entropy and randomness
- Discrete sequence sampling of a continuous torus can create aliasing; requires discrepancy analysis to ensure uniform coverage.

Key length detection
- Geometric key = closed path period; numeric key = fundamental cycle length of sequence.

Basic insight
- Advantages, if any, must manifest as reduced harmonic distortion, higher Q, or improved coupling vs. standard windings.

Feeds later subjects
- Provides concrete candidates for Ch. 22 harmonic control and Ch. 24 measurement validation.

Validation tasks
- Synthesize current distributions from proposed windings and compute near‑field maps.
- Measure harmonic spectra vs. conventional toroids at equal wire/copper and drive.

Unanswered questions
1) Which parameter sets (R, r, pitch) minimize unwanted harmonics?
2) Does the sequence mapping yield measurable improvements across bandwidth, not only at a single f0?
3) What manufacturing tolerances are required to preserve predicted advantages?
