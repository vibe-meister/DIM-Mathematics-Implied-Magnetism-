Section 5 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) Induction with quantitative frameworks [PART V Lines 2–61, 69–153]
2) Resonance & toroidal LC systems [PART V Lines 155–373]
3) Motion-induced effects [PART V Lines 375–453]
4) Topology, vortex math, Rodin framework [PART V Lines 455–575]

Dependencies
- Induction (L, M) → resonance (LC, coupled equations, Q) → motion (F, τ, EMF) → topology (toroidal coordinates, V(n), B(θ,ϕ), P).
