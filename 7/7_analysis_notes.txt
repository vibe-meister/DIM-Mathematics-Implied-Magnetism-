Section 7 — Structured Notes (source-grounded)
Source: PART VII — FRINGE AND THEORETICAL E.txt

Created/Speculative equations and concepts (as labeled)
- Rodin sequence S_n=2^n mod 9 (winding/phase coding) [Lines 7–27].
- Vortex amplification model B_vortex(t) with α, f_vortex, ϕ [Lines 40–93].
- Scalar magnetic waves equation [Lines 96–127].
- Toroidal harmonic modulation B(θ,ϕ,t) [Lines 129–173].
- Coherent energy transfer P_net with η_ij [Lines 175–255].
- Fringe amplification G_fringe with F_phase=1+cos(Δϕ_vortex) [Lines 257–323].
- Spin–vortex coherence energy E_coh [Lines 325–415].
- Subtle flux coupling K_subtle [Lines 417–472].
- Multi-mode decay/oscillation B_fringe(t) [Lines 475–536].

Cautions/Limitations
- All items are “Created Equations” per source and require stringent controls, independent power accounting, and null tests.

Usage Guidance
- Treat as hypothesis templates for experimental design; reference Parts IV–V for protocols, and Parts I–III for baseline physics.
