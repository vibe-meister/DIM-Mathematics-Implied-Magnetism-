CHAPTER 29: QUANTUM‑COHERENT AND SUBTLE ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS — ANALYSIS
=======================================================================

Scope note
Adds quantum metrics (entanglement via concurrence) and speculative weak‑flux couplings. Treat with rigorous metrology, full error budgets, and negative controls.

Interesting patterns
- E_coh∝Σ J_ij S_i·S_j cos θ_ij mirrors Heisenberg‑type Hamiltonians; enables concrete tests in spin‑arrays.
- K_subtle∝ln(r/a)×β_coherence introduces a geometry‑log law with a free “coherence” factor; requires careful nulling to avoid ordinary EM pickup.
- Multi‑exponential B_fringe(t)=Σ B_n e^{−t/τ_n} cos(ω_n t+ϕ_n) suggests decomposable modes; excellent for Prony/ESPRIT fitting.

Missing numbers
- Absent T2, noise floors, temperatures, sensor specs (NV, SQUID) and shielding factors.
- No calibration standards or blinding protocols; needed to distinguish real effects from drift/EMI.

Frequency analysis
- Quantum signals are narrowband and fragile; dynamical decoupling can extend bandwidth but complicates interpretation.
- Weak‑flux detection should use lock‑in at known modulation; verify phase reversal on reference flip to reject crosstalk.

Sequences
- Prepare → entangle (29.1) → tomography/estimator for E → vary J_ij, θ_ij → plot E vs. control parameters.
- Subtle flux: null run → modulated run → phase‑flip control → interleaved blinded repetitions.

Entropy and randomness
- Decoherence randomizes phase; quantify with T2* and Allan variance of sensors.
- Environmental drifts create pseudo‑signals; randomized phase schedules and sham hardware reduce bias.

Key length detection
- Coherence length/time act as experiment keys; total run time must fit within stability windows.

Basic insight
- Without stringent controls, subtle‑energy observations are indistinguishable from instrumentation artifacts; prioritize falsification paths.

Feeds later subjects
- If robust, may inform protected modes (helicity/topological) and sensor applications; if not, results still bound claims quantitatively.

Concrete tests
- Report concurrence C and derived E with confidence intervals; verify invariance under local unitaries.
- Lock‑in detection of modulated weak‑flux; show 180° phase flip when reference is inverted.
- Cross‑lab replication with blinded analysis pipelines.

Unanswered questions (29)
1) Which platforms provide sufficient T2 and sensitivity for spin‑vortex protocols?
2) What modulation/detection scheme maximizes SNR while excluding EMI and thermal drift?
3) Which null/negative controls convincingly rule out conventional coupling paths?
