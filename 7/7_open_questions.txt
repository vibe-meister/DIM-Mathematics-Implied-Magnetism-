Section 7 — Open Questions and Testable Predictions (source-derived)

Rodin/Vortex Models [Lines 7–38, 40–93]
- Does S_n-guided phasing measurably alter spectra/Q vs controls across bandwidth? Quantify α and f_vortex under strict power accounting.

Scalar/Toroidal Fields [Lines 96–173]
- Are scalar-wave signatures observable beyond EM leakage with RF-tight enclosures? Can B(θ,ϕ,t) modes be cleanly isolated in toroids?

Coherent Transfer & Overunity Metrics [Lines 175–323]
- Can P_net=Σ η_ij I_i E_j exceed classical expectations without violating energy accounting? How does Δϕ_vortex map to G_fringe in blinded tests?

Quantum/Subtle Measures [Lines 325–472]
- Is E_coh reconstructable from measurable proxies (correlation functions)? Is K_subtle=(μ0/2π)ln(r/a)·β_coherence experimentally resolvable?

Propagation & Decay [Lines 475–536]
- Can multi-mode B_fringe(t) fits uniquely identify coherent propagation vs artifact? Stability of τ_n, ω_n, ϕ_n across replications?

End.
