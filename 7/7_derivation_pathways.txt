Section 7 — Derivation Pathways (from provided created equations only)

Pathway A — Rodin/Vortex Phasing
1) Implement S_n=2^n mod 9 phasing; compare B_vortex(t) parameters (α,f_vortex,ϕ) vs control coils at equal copper and drive.

Pathway B — Scalar/Toroidal Field Tests
1) Attempt ∇²Φ−μϵ ∂²Φ/∂t²=0 detection with RF shielding and nulls.
2) Excite B(θ,ϕ,t)=B0 cos(kθ+mϕ+ωt); map modes; verify isolation from conventional leakage.

Pathway C — Coherent Transfer Metrics
1) Measure P_net(t)=Σ η_ij I_i E_j; correlate with Δϕ_vortex via G_fringe; enforce blinded, independent power metering.

Pathway D — Quantum/Subtle Probes
1) Estimate E_coh via proxies; compute K_subtle from r,a sweeps; assess β_coherence bounds.

Pathway E — Propagation/Decay Identification
1) Fit B_fringe(t)=Σ B_n e^{−t/τ_n} cos(ω_n t+ϕ_n); perform model selection to rule out mundane origins.

End.
