Section 7 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) Rodin-based frameworks [Lines 2–41]
2) Exotic field manipulations (scalar/toroidal) [Lines 94–173]
3) Coherent/overunity hypotheses [Lines 175–323]
4) Quantum-coherent and subtle interactions [Lines 325–472]
5) Propagation/decay model [Lines 475–536]

Dependencies
- Phasing/winding → field models → transfer metrics → quantum/subtle → propagation signatures.
