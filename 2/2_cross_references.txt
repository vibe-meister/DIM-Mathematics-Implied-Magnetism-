Section 2 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) PART II overview [PART II Lines 1–2]
2) Induction & flux dynamics [PART II Lines 2–44]
3) Resonance & magnetic circuits [PART II Lines 45–85]
4) Motion-induced effects [PART II Lines 86–121]
5) Topology & geometry [PART II Lines 123–162]

Dependencies
- Induction/flux → resonance (L, M feed LC and coupling) → motion (EMF/force relations) → topology (geometry shaping fields).
