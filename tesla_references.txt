Usage in this project (planned extraction targets)
- Baseline design choices to ground from these sources (pending extraction):
  - Primary/secondary geometry (N, R, r, A, spacing)
  - Coupling strategy (qualitative guidance), initial k bounds (if present qualitatively)
  - Tuning workflow (top-load, spark gap, grounding)
  - Measurement workflow (resonance identification, bandwidth/Q procedures)

Notes
- This file lists sources and the parameters they can inform. No numbers are added here. Once specific quotes/pages are extracted, we will cite them and propose baseline design choices accordingly.
