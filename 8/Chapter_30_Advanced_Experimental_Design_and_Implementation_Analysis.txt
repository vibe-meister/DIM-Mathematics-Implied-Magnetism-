CHAPTER 30: ADVANCED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION — ANALYSIS
=====================================================================

Scope note
Translates theory into build–measure–amplify workflows: (30.1) fabrication, (30.2) measurement/control, (30.3) energy transfer/amplification. Includes both classical formulas and labeled speculative equations.

Interesting patterns
- Direct geometry→field mapping: B_toroid=μNI/(2πr) centers controllables (μ,N,I,r) for target flux density.
- Vortex‑alignment enhancement adds a sinusoidal phase term (1+β sin θ_phase), explicitly making phasing a design variable.
- Time‑dependent B(t) includes base vector plus weighted per‑coil modulations, matching multi‑coil HIL control strategies.

Missing numbers
- No tolerances for r, winding placement, or μ variability; absent ESR and inter‑turn capacitance models.
- Lacking metrology specs (bandwidth, isolation, noise floors) for HV/RF measurements.
- No target β ranges, θ_phase sweep plans, or acceptance criteria.

Frequency analysis
- B(t)=B0 cos(ωt+ϕ)+γ Σ B_i f_i(t) implies carrier plus sidebands; spectral purity reflects control loop quality.
- Phase‑alignment gain G_res≈Q_eff/(1−cos Δϕ) suggests divergence as Δϕ→0; in practice limited by loss and loop delay.

Sequences
- Fabrication: CAD → coil winding → fixture/build tolerances → inspection (CMM/microscope) → electrical check.
- Measurement: instrumentation verification → calibration → baseline (single‑coil) → multi‑coil modulation tests.
- Amplification: phase‑sweep Δϕ → measure Q_eff, gain, stability → iterate wiring/coupling.

Structural patterns
- Clear 3‑block pipeline: make → measure → optimize; each block feeds quantitative parameters to the next.

Entropy and randomness
- Manufacturing variance randomizes coupling; calibration and matching reduce spread.
- Measurement noise (HV dividers, probes) injects randomness; lock‑in and averaging combat it.

Key length detection
- Spatial key: mean circumference 2πr (toroid) governs modal density.
- Temporal key: modulation period(s) in f_i(t); use to detect desynchronization.

Basic insight
- Robust performance comes from alignment of geometry, phasing, and metrology limits; phasing cannot compensate for poor build or noisy instruments.

Feeds later subjects
- Informs patent model evaluation (Ch. 31), lab replication (Ch. 32), and real‑world claims (Ch. 33–35).

Concrete checks
- Validate B_toroid against Hall/NV measurements around the core; map vs. r and I.
- Quantify β via flux increase at optimal θ_phase; report uncertainty.
- Extract Q_eff via ring‑down and −3 dB bandwidth; require ≤10% discrepancy.

Unanswered questions (30)
1) What fabrication tolerances (winding pitch, placement) keep coupling/k within spec?
2) Which probe/divider chain meets bandwidth/isolation targets for HV RF?
3) What Δϕ schedule maximizes gain without instability across N coils?
