CHAPTER 32: SPECIALIST & LABORATORY UNPUBLISHED WORKS — ANALYSIS
================================================================

Scope note
Synthesizes lab notes and unpublished reports with a damping/phase superposition form: B_total=Σ B_i e^{−t/τ_i} cos ϕ_i. Focus on retention, decay, and phase control in high‑Q loops.

Interesting patterns
- Decomposition into damped cosines supports Prony/ESPRIT extraction of τ_i and ϕ_i.
- High‑Q aims reflected in long τ_i; phase spread ϕ_i governs residual coherence.

Missing numbers
- No instrumentation limits, temperature stability, or shielding factors.
- Absent raw datasets for independent re‑analysis.

Frequency analysis
- Spectral lines at ω_i with linewidths ~1/τ_i; slow drift appears as frequency wander.

Sequences
- Acquire long time‑series → fit modal components → correlate τ_i with build/drive parameters → iterate.

Entropy and randomness
- Environmental drift and sensor flicker produce apparent “modes”; require randomized protocols and null runs.

Key length detection
- Dominant τ_i provides time‑key; experiment length must exceed several τ_i for robust estimates.

Basic insight
- Without raw data and controls, long‑τ claims are not verifiable; publishing datasets is essential.

Feeds later subjects
- Informs reproducibility metrics (Ch. 35) and claim vetting (Ch. 33).

Checks
- Provide raw time‑series and analysis scripts; reproduce τ_i within confidence intervals across sessions.

Unanswered questions (32)
1) What environmental controls (T, EMI) are required to sustain long τ_i?
2) How repeatable are τ_i and ϕ_i across nominally identical builds?
3) Do phase‑aligned excitations measurably extend τ_i vs. random phases?
