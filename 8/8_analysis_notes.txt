Sources: PART VIII — APPLICATION AND CREATIO.txt and Chapters 30–35 analysis files

Fabrication/Measurement
- B_toroid=μNI/(2πr) for target flux; phasing enhancement B_vortex=B_toroid(1+β sin θ_phase) (created) [Lines 7–84].
- B(t)=B0 cos(ωt+ϕ) ê_toroid + γ Σ B_i f_i(t) (created) [Lines 86–179].

Energy/Amplification/Modeling
- P_net=Σ η_ij I_i E_j; G_res=Q_eff/(1−cos Δϕ) (created) [Lines 181–310].
- M_eff=Σ k_ij L_i L_j from patents (created) [Lines 316–386].
- B_total=Σ B_i e^{−t/τ_i} cos ϕ_i (created) [Lines 388–471].
- κ metric (created) [Lines 473–551].
- V_induced(t)=−d/dt Σ Φ_i (1+λ cos θ_i) (created) [Lines 555–636].
- Reproducibility R metric (created) [Lines 640–672].

Cautions/Limitations
- Missing tolerances, metrology specs, and parameter bounds for β, θ_phase, γ, η_ij, k_ij, τ_i, λ, δ_uncertainty (see Ch. 30–35 analyses).

Separation
- Mainstream: B_toroid relation.
- Created/speculative: all other listed equations; use protocols from Parts IV–V and reproducibility metrics from Ch. 35 before inference.
