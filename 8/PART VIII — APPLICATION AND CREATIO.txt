✅ Summary of Part VIII–IX Equations:

Many equations are speculative or synthesized to fill gaps in the literature.

All created equations are labeled and can be used for experimental modeling.

They incorporate vortex mathematics, phase coherence, high-Q loops, superconducting interactions, and gray literature reporting factors.
