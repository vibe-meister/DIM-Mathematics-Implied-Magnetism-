CHAPTER 31: PATENT‑BASED MAGNETIC SYSTEM MODELING — ANALYSIS
===========================================================

Scope note
Abstracts patent topologies into an effective coupling model: M_eff=Σ k_ij L_i L_j. Goal: compare claimed arrays with measurable coupling and transfer efficiency.

Interesting patterns
- Patent schematics often imply high homogeneity; summation over pairs captures superposition of mutuals.
- Model is agnostic to geometry details, enabling quick screening before full FEM.

Missing numbers
- No L_i, k_ij estimates or bounds; lacks spacing/orientation distributions typical in real builds.
- Absent efficiency metrics and thermal limits to contextualize M_eff benefits.

Frequency analysis
- M_eff shapes bandwidth and coupling; high M_eff can overdamp if R is not minimized.
- Frequency‑dependent L(ω), k(ω) from proximity/capacitive paths are not yet included.

Sequences
- Extract topology from patent → estimate L_i, k_ij (back‑of‑envelope) → compute M_eff → down‑select for FEM → prototype.

Entropy and randomness
- Manufacturing scatter in k_ij broadens performance; Monte Carlo on tolerances recommended.

Key length detection
- Array lattice constants and loop perimeters set dominant modal spacings.

Basic insight
- A compact M_eff model can falsify over‑ambitious claims early; only designs with robust coupling under tolerances proceed.

Feeds later subjects
- Bridges to lab replication (Ch. 32) and forum/gray claims (Ch. 33, 35) by giving a quantitative baseline.

Checks
- Cross‑validate M_eff predictions with FEM and measured S‑parameters.
- Compare predicted transfer efficiency versus measured under matched loads.

Unanswered questions (31)
1) What realistic k_ij distributions arise from target coil spacing/orientation?
2) How strongly do parasitics at operating ω reduce the effective M compared to DC estimates?
3) What M_eff is needed to outperform simpler, fewer‑coil designs?
