CHAPTER 35: GRAY LITERATURE CURATION & VERIFICATION — ANALYSIS
==============================================================

Scope note
Defines a reproducibility metric R=(# reproducible / # total)·(1−δ_uncertainty). Goal: triage claims and identify robust effects across heterogeneous sources.

Interesting patterns
- R penalizes both low replication and high uncertainty; encourages better reporting.
- Can be extended with weights for lab credibility and data completeness.

Missing numbers
- No clear thresholds for acceptable δ_uncertainty; needs rubric for instrumentation/documentation quality.
- Absent procedures for independent audit.

Frequency analysis
- Reports often single‑frequency; require multi‑frequency validation to avoid cherry‑picking.

Sequences
- Define rubric → collect datasets → compute R per claim → publish dashboards → prioritize replication.

Entropy and randomness
- Selection bias and p‑hacking inflate perceived success; preregistration and blinding reduce entropy of claims.

Key length detection
- Study duration and replication count are temporal keys; longer keys increase confidence in R.

Basic insight
- A transparent R framework makes gray literature actionable by quantifying uncertainty and replication success.

Feeds later subjects
- Provides filters for which designs move to formal publication or patent pursuit.

Checks
- Third‑party re‑analysis of shared datasets should reproduce R within tolerance.

Unanswered questions (35)
1) What δ_uncertainty rubric is fair and practical across the community?
2) Which minimal reporting standards enable independent recomputation of R?
3) How should R be weighted by lab independence and prior credibility?
