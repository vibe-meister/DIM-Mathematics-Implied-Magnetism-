CHAPTER 34: PRIVATE COLLECTIONS & ARCHIVES — ANALYSIS
=====================================================

Scope note
Models induced voltage from summed fluxes with a vortex‑phase factor λcos θ_i(t). Captures both classical induction and speculative phase alignment.

Interesting patterns
- V_induced(t)=−d/dt Σ Φ_i(t)(1+λ cos θ_i) mixes slow flux drift with fast phase modulation → rich spectra.
- Highlights role of coherent phase schedules across loops.

Missing numbers
- No λ bounds, phase schedule definitions, or instrumentation specs.
- Absent coil geometries and flux magnitude ranges.

Frequency analysis
- Expect carrier(s) from Φ_i dynamics plus sidebands at phase‑schedule frequencies.
- Phase noise and timing jitter set practical limits on coherence.

Sequences
- Archive reconstruction → redraw schematics → parameter extraction → synthesize expected waveforms → compare to recordings.

Entropy and randomness
- Incomplete archival data raises ambiguity; Monte Carlo over plausible parameters can bound expectations.

Key length detection
- Phase schedule period acts as key; cross‑correlate with output to measure coherence.

Basic insight
- Even with partial records, a parametric model can test plausibility and guide reconstruction experiments.

Feeds later subjects
- Provides inputs to reproducibility metrics (Ch. 35) and forum κ comparisons (Ch. 33).

Checks
- Differentiate recorded waveforms and compare with model predictions under plausible λ, θ_i(t).

Unanswered questions (34)
1) What λ ranges are plausible without violating conservation under measured losses?
2) Which phase schedules maximize output while remaining stable?
3) How sensitive are predictions to uncertainties in Φ_i(t) from archival sources?
