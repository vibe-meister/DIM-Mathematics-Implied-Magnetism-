CHAPTER 33: FORUM THREADS & TECHNICAL BLOGS — ANALYSIS
======================================================

Scope note
Introduces an energy coupling factor κ based on reported P_out/P_in weighted by a coherence factor. Aim: standardize claim comparisons and identify reproducible effects.

Interesting patterns
- κ aggregates multi‑node inputs/outputs; acts as a normalized transfer metric.
- F_coherence formalizes phase alignment claims; can be independently measured.

Missing numbers
- No error bars, sampling methods, or calibration procedures referenced in typical posts.
- Absent standardized loads and instrumentation; results are not directly comparable.

Frequency analysis
- Many setups are narrowband; κ must be reported vs. frequency, not single points.

Sequences
- Define measurement protocol → standard loads → log inputs/outputs with timestamps → compute κ → share raw data and scripts.

Entropy and randomness
- Community data is noisy and heterogeneous; meta‑analysis with quality filters is necessary.

Key length detection
- Reporting window length acts as temporal key; too short windows inflate κ due to transients.

Basic insight
- A transparent κ protocol with open data reduces confusion; extraordinary κ requires extraordinary documentation.

Feeds later subjects
- Supports curation/verification (Ch. 35) and benchmarking against patent/lab designs (Ch. 31–32).

Checks
- Recompute κ from raw logs; verify energy conservation within measurement uncertainty where expected.

Unanswered questions (33)
1) What minimum data/reporting standards yield meaningful κ across contributors?
2) How do phase‑coherence metrics correlate with κ in comparable rigs?
3) Can a small set of reference builds anchor κ values for the community?
