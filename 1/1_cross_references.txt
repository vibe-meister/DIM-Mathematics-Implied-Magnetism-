Section 1 — Cross-References & Reading Order (source-grounded)

Suggested Reading Order
1) PART I overview [PART I Lines 1–16]
2) Introduction to Magnetism (structure and units) [PART I Lines 17–42]
3) Atomic/Subatomic Foundations (quantum origins) [PART I Lines 43–77]
4) Field Theory of Magnetism (Maxwell, A, boundaries, energy) [PART I Lines 78–114]
5) Magnetic Materials and Properties (classification, hysteresis, anisotropy) [PART I Lines 115–166]

Dependencies
- Units and core concepts → quantum sources → field equations/potentials → materials behavior.
- Equations explicitly cited in Chapter 3 Analysis Lines 61–65 underpin later quantitative work.
